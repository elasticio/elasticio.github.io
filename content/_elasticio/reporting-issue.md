If you have encountered an issue while working on the platform or you need an assistance please send us an e-mail to support@elastic.io.

When you send an e-mail a support ticket will be opened on your behalf and an automated reply would give you the ticket number which you can track by registering in our support portal. The support portal credentials are not the same as your credentials while logged into the platform. If this is the first time submitting an issue a new account will be created for you automatically. If you have submitted an issue before you already have an account - login here.

To help you and us get to the bottom of the issue as quickly as possible we ask you to describe your issue in as much detail as possible. If you don't know where to start, we compiled a list for you to go through before submitting the e-mail.
