## Features

### Hidden component deprecated functions

To streamline the user experience while building integration flows, we introduce a separation
between component active and deprecated functions. From now on all
deprecated functions will be listed under **Deprecated Functions**
menu which will be hidden/closed by default. Here is an example of Functions tab
in Database component where the **Deprecated Functions** menu is open:

![Deprecated Functions](/assets/img/RN/2102/hidden-functions.png)

We have also improved the look and feel of the radio selectors in general.

## Improvements and Updates

In this release we continued to streamline and improve the platform
UI pages. For example viewing and editing JSON objects while in integrator mode
is now more comfortable.

### verifyCredentials errors

We improve the rendering of errors while component credential verification fails. If the
component code reports an error, this will be shown in the credential UI as it is.

### Node.js Sailor updates

With this release we continue improvements of the Node.js Sailor, the base
library used to compile any Node.js based component code during the platform deployments.

Node.js Sailor version `2.6.22` is introduced to enable `keep-alive` for the global
HTTP agent. This release provides a remedy to limitation of outgoing HTTP connection
numbers often imposed by the cloud providers.

Node.js Sailor version `2.6.23` is introduced to prevent retry of the AMQP
connection errors in the system. It addresses such errors like
"Cannot read property 'publish' of undefined". In general, the AMQP connection
errors contain no data which can be used to put back into the message queues to retry.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixed the problem with unsaved credentials. It is now impossible to select the credential without saving it first. If you fill-in all the required fields and select the credential, then it will be saved.
*   Addressed the problem with the Configuration component credentials during the recipe activation phase.
