## Improvements and Updates

- Enable keep-alive for global http agent in sailor.
Enabled keep-alive for global HTTP agent.

New elasticio-sailor-nodejs version 2.6.22

- When verifyCredentials fails, reason is not rendered in the UI.
Now Frontend get the reason of credentials verification failed if component provides it and display in the error message

- Fix sailor error "Cannot read property 'publish' of undefined".
If while pod starting happens error with amqp connection the sailor is trying to put this error in the error queue and because of the obvious reason it can not put it, and it is trying to repeat it forever (with delay increasing).

Now sailor doesn't try to put an error in the queue if it has amqp connection error.

**New sailor's version: 2.6.23
