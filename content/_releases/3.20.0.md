## New Features

### Frontend

There is the new page with quota usages on the Navigation Panel, section Contract Settings:

![Navigation Panel - Quota Usages](/assets/img/RN/320/Screenshot_1.png)

### Recipes

You can now export a Flow to a Recipe via the following API endpoint:

`POST /v2/flows/:flow_id/export-to-recipe/`

Find more info about it [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#create-a-recipe-from-existing-flow).

To list all available Recipes, use the `GET /v2/recipes` endpoint. For the first iteration (until private/public Recipes will be introduced) the URL should contain the `contract_id`: `/v2/recipes?contract_id={{CONTRACT_ID}}`. You can read more about it [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#retrieve-all-recipes).

We changed the structure of `POST/PATCH /v2/recipes`, and the response structure of `GET /v2/recipes`. Check [this section]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#recipes-(experimental)) for details.

> **IMPORTANT:** Recipes are still beta, so we don't recommend using them with critical data or production.


### Other

There are new endpoints you can use to see quota statistics for all Workspaces in your Contract. Additionally, there are endpoints for per-Flow and per-Workspace resource usage control, and Workspace or Contract usage history display. See details [here](#other-stuff).

Also, you can now use `&ref` in JSONschema. However, reference by `$id` is still not supported.

## Fixed Bugs

### List Of Fixed Bugs

- Now `POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE /v2/flows/:id/draft` are only allowed with
`WORKSPACE.FLOW.EDIT` permission.

- Component data sample maximum provision time before timeout is 1 minute now.

- Also, we fixed the issue with wrong URL in the developer team invitation letter.
