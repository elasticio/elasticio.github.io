## Features

### Help Links for Components
You can put help links on different stages of integration Flow creation:

- When creating and verifying new Credentials

- When selecting trigger or action of the Component

- When receiving Credentials errors

- When configuring Component fields and mapping, etc.

These links will lead to corresponding documents. You can find information on how to configure help links [here](/guides/configuring-help-links.html).

### Edit Message Before Retrying Error
If an error occurs due to bad inputs or a misconfiguration, you can now edit those inputs and submit the record for re-processing at the point of failure. This way you don’t have to process the entire message from the beginning of the Flow:

### Static CSS Classes
You can now create your own JSS styles based on static CSS classes.

### $getPassthrough()
We introduced the `$getPassthrough()` functionality, which allows you to avoid certain hardcoded "elasticio" mentions.

>**NOTE:** The following Components must be be updated:

- elasticio/rest-api-component
- elasticio/router-component
- elasticio/filter-component
- elasticio/splitter-component
- elasticio/jsonata-transform-component

### Mapper Fields Help Popup
You will now see help icons in the new mapper. They will appear if the particular property in the metadata provides enough information:

- If the property has examples field, we display the following text in the hep: “Here are some example values accepted by this field: `X, Y, Z`”, `X, Y, Z` being the elements in the examples array.

- If the property is optional and has the default field, we display the text: "This field is optional. If you don’t provide any value it will be filled with `X`", if `default=X`

- If the property is of `enum` type, we display the following text in the help: “This field accepts a fixed set of values only. Following values are allowed: X, Y, Z” where X, Y, Z are the values of the `enum`

- A combination of the abovementioned cases is allowed

- Update its *component.json* by adding `"required": true/false`, "`examples": ["the array of examples values"]`, `"enum": ["the array of enum values"]`, `"default": "this will displayed in optional field if you don’t provide any value there"` properties into `metadata.in.properties.[property]`.


## Improvements

### Link Log with Associated Thread
You can go from from the record on the Logs Page directly to the associated thread now. In case the log record contains `thread_id`, you will see "3 dots" icon, which appears on hover. Click it and it presents a link that opens the execution you need:

### Threads Page Performance
Improved performance of `getThread`. Instead of doing `25` requests it does `1` that takes about 30% of the time of `listThreads`. Thus, the overall performance is `3` times better.

## Fixed bugs
* If not specified during Tenant creation, `css_enabled` attribute will be `false` by default.

* Fixed *Continue* button in the new mapper for Salesforce Component.
