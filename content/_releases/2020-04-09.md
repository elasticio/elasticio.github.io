## Features

### Help Links for Components
You can put help links on different stages of integration Flow creation:

- When creating and verifying new Credentials

- When selecting trigger or action of the Component

- When receiving Credentials errors

- When configuring Component fields and mapping, etc.

These links will lead to corresponding documents. You can find information on how to configure help links [here](/guides/configuring-help-links.html).

### Edit Message Before Retrying Error
If an error occurs due to bad inputs or a misconfiguration, you can now edit those inputs and submit the record for re-processing at the point of failure. This way you donâ€™t have to process the entire message from the beginning of the Flow:

### Static CSS Classes
You can now create your own JSS styles based on static CSS classes.


## Improvements

### Link Log with Associated Thread
You can go from from the record on the Logs Page directly to the associated thread now. In case the log record contains `thread_id`, you will see "3 dots" icon, which appears on hover. Click it and it presents a link that opens the execution you need:

* If not specified during Tenant creation, `css_enabled` attribute will be `false` by default.
