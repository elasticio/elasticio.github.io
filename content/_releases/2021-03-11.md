## Improvements and Updates

### OAuth2 client creation in recipe activation

This release extends the functionality of the authentication client creation. Now
you can create OAuth2 authentication clients right from the recipe activation
menu.

### Loader for workspaces list in the invitation form

This specific improvement addresses the issue when the UI would not show more
than 20 workspaces in the invitation drop-down. Now loader would appear in case
you have more than 20 workspaces. Eventually the list of all workspaces would
be presented in the drop-down list.

> Please Note: only workspaces you have access to will be loaded. In case when you
> are the tenant administrator all workspaces will be available.

### Configure dynamic flow control

If your component is written in Java then you can now disable the dynamic
flow control in the step by setting the `ELASTICIO_AMQP_PUBLISH_CONFIRM_ENABLED`
environment variable in the component repository as `false`. **This is only possible if your component is using the latest Java sailor version `3.3.5`.**

### SAML2 SSO Client

With this release we introduce initial support for SAML2 SSO Client.


### API-Docs URL setup

With this release we introduced new parameter `api_docs_url` to the tenant
configuration and a capability to manage and redirect visitors to the correct
API-documentation version. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant, white-labelled
environment where each tenant would have a unique api address.

To benefit from this new parameter you must set the `api_docs_url` parameter and
its value to the tenant record:

*   If `api_docs_url` is set in the tenant record, every link to the API documentation will be redirected to the provided address.
*   If `api_docs_url` is not set, every link will redirect to the default API documentation of the main/default tenant. The default value is `https://[tenant.api_domain]/docs`. **Don't set the `api_docs_url` for the main/default tenant, you will get a redirect loop.**

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixed the problem when the deleted content-based-router component step with not configured branches would block publishing of the draft.
*   Addressed the UI bug when the mapped data would disappear after reopening the flow to examine.
*   Fixed the error in copy flow when the dynamic `selectModel` was malformed due to 3rd party host issues.
*   Addressed the problem when no workspaces were shown while exporting the flow.
*   Fixed the UI bug when the header part would not load while opening the flow to view or edit.
*   Addressed the redirect loop problem of the api-docs service after the nginx ingress controller upgrade.
