## New Features

 20.11 Platform Release

### Toggle File Conversion on Webhook

Automatic conversion of raw XML files on Webhook is toggled in *component.json* with `consumesRawData` flag. If `true`, then Webhook will not convert incoming data to JSON.

### Errors Retention Policies

There is now a limit that defines the maximum number of errors we list for a Flow. If the limit is reached, no new errors are listed for the given Flow anymore. This new limit will protect you from the "chatterbox" Flows that tend to spam too much.

New `MAX_ERROR_RECORDS_COUNT` environment variable was added. If the amount of errors per Flow gets higher then `MAX_ERROR_RECORDS_COUNT` value, we remove old error records and show corresponding notification in UI.

Also, we added a new k8s CronJob `remove-excess-error-records`. This job is clearing oldest flow error records if they are exceeding limit. The default limit is `1000` records per Flow, and is set by `MAX_ERROR_RECORDS_COUNT` environment variable.

### Snapshot Management UI

In the Flow UI you can now view and edit snapshot of the trigger. Snapshot management is accessed via *Advanced Settings* in Step summary:

![Advanced Settings Snapshots](/assets/img/RN/20.11/snapshot-management.png)

Then you get to snapshot manager itself:

### Vertical Scaling

You can now use *Advanced Settings* section in *Step Summary* tab to configure prefetch.

> **Note:** the changes will be applied after clicking the *Finish step* button.

### Tracking Flows Suspension

`Flow Suspended` was added to the segment.io, so you can track Flows suspension process.

### Step Message Prefetch Count

You can now configure step message prefetch count through the API. We added a new `prefetch` field as a parameter to `nodeConfig` section of the `/v2/flows` endpoint. The mapper-step gets the same prefetch as the previous step.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
"attributes": {
        "nodes_config": {
            "step_1": {
                "prefetch": 4
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Logs Per Page

The default number of logs displayed per page is `200`. You can set this number to: `400`, `600`, `800` or `1000`.

### Trigger Emails

New emails are sent in case of events of the following scales:

- [Developer Team](#developer-team-emails)
- [Contract](#contract-emails)
- [Workspace](#workspace-emails)

#### Developer Team Emails:

1\. Removing a member from a Developer Team. Email sent to the removed member.

#### Contract Emails

1\. Contract suspended. Emails sent to all members of the Contract.

2\. Removing a member from a contract. Email sent to the removed member.

3\. Contract re-activated from suspension. Emails sent to all members of the Contract.

4\. Contract removed. Emails sent to all members of the Contract.

#### Workspace Emails

1\. Removing a member from a team. Email sent to the removed member.

2\. Workspace removed. Emails sent to all members of the Workspace.
