Version 3.15.0 is full of new stuff. Let's see what we added for you in the following sections:

-   [New Features](#new-features)

-   [Fixed Bugs](#fixed-bugs)

-   [Technical Details](#technical-stuff)

### New Features

Check out the improvements in the following subsections:

-   [Full and Limited Workspaces](#full-and-limited-workspaces)

-   [Contracts and Workspaces](#contracts-and-workspaces)

-   [Other](#other)

#### Full and Limited Workspaces

Now there are two types of workspaces: `full` and `limited`. `Full` workspaces are well-known to you, so `limited` type is the new thing. Basically, in `limited` workspaces the workflows are set to stop automatically after a certain time period.

`Limited` workspaces are mainly meant for trial periods. Check out more info about them [here](/getting-started/contracts-and-workspaces). By default, your workspaces will be `full`. Here are some more [technical details](#full-and-limited-workspaces-stuff) for those interested.



#### Contracts and Workspaces

There will be no more "stray" contracts, meaning that any contract will always have an Owner. The first member of a contract will automatically be assigned the role of Owner. Also, you cannot just leave the contract without "administration". If you're the last member, you can either delete the contract or terminate your account from the platform. As a general rule, if the last member is removed from the contract, the contract is deleted automatically. Check out the [technical details](#contracts-and-workspaces-stuff).

You can now rename workspaces in the UI. That is, if you have the right [permission](/guides/managing-user-roles-in-a-tenant), of course.

As a casual improvement, you can now enjoy optimized internal [resource management](#contracts-and-workspaces-stuff) in contracts.


#### Other

All in all, we've made a few minor additions to improve performance. For example, we removed an entire tier of overhead by using pods instead of jobs for flows. While performance gain is not huge, all actions (retrieve sample, start/stop flow, etc.) are now faster, and this effect is cumulative.  

Also, now user registration process is optimized. It works via
API calls instead of directly via Database, which is generally better and more secure.

You can find details [here](#other-stuff).


## Fixed Bugs

-  We updated JSONata versions used in the platform to `1.6.3`, so all associated processes will go smoothly. Don't forget to update mapper, router and JSONata-transform.


## Technical Stuff

**WARNING!** Boring technical stuff ahead. Read only if you have to.

#### Full and Limited Workspaces Stuff

To define `full` type as default, set `tenant.defaultWorkspaceType` to `full`.

There is a new *Wiper* script that handles limited workspaces. It is a job `stop-limited-flows` that periodically stops flows in limited workspaces. Also, we implemented a new API endpoint for *Wiper* to get flows that have to be stopped in limited workspaces. The response consists of an array of IDs of flows that require stopping. You can modify the TTL (Time to Live) of the limited flows by using the environment variable `LIMITED_WORKSPACE_FLOW_TTL_IN_MINUTES`. The default value is `10 minutes`.

The *Wiper* job `suspend-tasks-with-failing-containers` will stop failed flows in limited workspaces, instead of suspending them, as it does in the full workspaces.

#### Contracts and Workspaces Stuff

A user without owner role will not be added to empty contract via `POST /v2/:contract_id/invites` or `POST /v2/:contract_id/members` by default.
`POST /v2/contracts/:contract_id/members` will return `409` if contract has no members and `payload.role` doesn't contain owner.
`POST /v2/contracts/:contract_id/invites` will return `409` if contract has no members and `payload.role` doesn't contain owner.

To disable this effect you need to set environment variable `DISABLE_CONTRACT_MUST_HAVE_OWNER` to `"true"` into secret. After that it is possible to add member without owner role to empty contract.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
{
    "DISABLE_CONTRACT_MUST_HAVE_OWNER": "true"
}
```
**Note:** because of environment variables processing, the value `false` is being converted into a string (`"false"`) and considered as truthy value. In order to set the behavior back to defaults, it is better to remove this environment variable from the secret at all.

**To not create the default workspace**

The default Workspace won't be created in the following cases:

  1\. `POST` new member into the Contract.

  2\. Redeeming an invite.

  3\. New user registration.

  The page with **Create New Workspace** button will appear instead.

#### Other Stuff

Added/changed environment variables that control CPU and memory requests/limits.
Make sure the following environment variables are set:
```
COMPONENT_MEM_DEFAULT=256
COMPONENT_MEM_DEFAULT_LIMIT=256
COMPONENT_MEM_JAVA=512
COMPONENT_MEM_JAVA_LIMIT=512
COMPONENT_CPU=0.1
COMPONENT_CPU_LIMIT=1
```
All new pods in k8s are started with `ImagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`.

*Reset snapshot* function is disabled while the flow is running. You can reset snapshot only when the flow is stopped.
