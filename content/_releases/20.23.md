## Features

We are happy to announce that our Executions and Logs pages graduated from the beta
stage to a full production. Thank you for all early adopters who provided the
valuable feedback. With your help we improved these pages immensely.

### Topics UI

Introducing UI for publish-subscribe (pub-sub) messaging pattern to compliment the
[pub-sub API endpoints]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#what-is-a-topic-unit?)
already introduced last month. Using the new Topics UI you can create and modify
the topics. The UI is accessible from the main navigation > Integrate sub-section.

![Topics section](/assets/img/getting-started/topics/topics-section.png)

We have a [dedicated page you can dive in](/getting-started/topics) to read more
and start using the Topics feature in your integration patterns.

To help implement pub-sub pattern we have a **[dedicated pub-sub component](/components/pub-sub)**
which we recommend to use to along with the Topics feature.

### Flow Message Queue UI

You have heard from us talking about how many messages were processed and how
many still in the messaging queue. This information was always hidden from you
under the wraps. Not anymore!

We introduce the new feature called **Flow Message Queue**. You can now see number
of messages in the queue for each of your flow steps. To access navigate to Executions,
select any active execution and look for the **Flow Queues** menu link along with
the Download Logs and View Flow links like in the picture below.

![Flow Queues Menu](/assets/img/RN/2023/flow-queues-menu.png)

Click on link to navigate to a special page showing the current queue of this flow
to see how many messages are in each flow-step of your integration flow.

![Flow Queues Menu](/assets/img/RN/2023/flow-queues-actual.png)

You can access the Flow Queues page from the Flow Designer and Flow-card menu
of general Flows page. However, the **Flow Queues are only available for actively running flows**.

You can also access the queue information using the `/v2/stats/queues/FLOW_ID`
API endpoint. More information is available from the
[API reference documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#stats).

### Java Sailor Update

We are releasing a new version of JAVA Sailor `3.1.0` which support a dynamic
flow control. More information is available from the `io.elastic:sailor-jvm`
[documentation pages](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.elastic/sailor-jvm/latest/index.html).


### Secrets Management Service for OAuth

Introducing a new centralised service to handle the secrets and OAuth credentials.
We aim to replace the credential handling mechanism in the whole platform.

> Please Note: **The service is still in early implementation and experimentation stage and it is not implemented on any currently released components.**

This new service aims to solve the problem of outdated and invalid secrets/tokens.
Here is the general approach for future component developments:

1.  Refreshing secrets/tokens are handled by the platform.
2.  Component can not and MUST not try to refresh token by itself, it should ask platform to do so.
3.  Component MUST ask platform for a valid value of secret every time it needs it. Caching is not recommended.
4.  When using this new service you MUST NOT use `this.emit('updateKeys')` mechanism.
5.  The `this.emit('updateKeys')` mechanism would still continue to co-exist until the deprecation of `Credentials` mechanism. It is still OK to use it for refreshing the `Credentials`.
6.  You MUST NOT use both `Secrets` and `Credentials` mechanisms at the same time in the same component.


## Improvements

### Mapper fixed version

The mapper component now adheres the  general approach of fixed components. The
version of the component is fixed when you save the flow draft. To use a newer
version of the mapper component in your integration flow you must create a new
draft of your flow and publish it again.

### Node.js Sailor 2.6.10 release

The new Node.js Sailor `2.6.10` is available. It adds support for the dynamic
flow control in the `return promise` interface in the Node.js Sailor. An update
of components using this interface and hoping to dynamically control the flow
messaging queues is highly recommended.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixes the problem when the dynamic metadata reloaded often during the flow-step configuration.
*   Fixes the problem when after series of random navigation through the flow-step design an error **Something technically Wrong** would appear making the flow in-recoverable.
*   Addresses the problem when by navigating forward and backwards without saving, in the flow-step design an error **Something technically Wrong** would appear making the flow in-recoverable.
*   Fixes the problem when the error retry in the executions page kept showing after a successful retry.


## Components

### [MongoDB Component](/components/mongodb)

Introducing a new integration component for MongoDB interaction. Only action
functions are available. This means component can not be used in the first step of

*   **NEW** - introducing action `Delete By Unique Criteria` which deletes document by a Unique Criteria.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Lookup By ID` which performs a lookup of document by ID.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Lookup By Unique Criteria` which performs lookup (at most 1) Document By Unique Criteria.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Lookup Plural` which performs lookup of many documents by a criteria.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Upsert By ID` which upserts document by ID.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Update Many` which updates documents in a collection.
*   **NEW** - introducing action `Upsert By Unique Criteria` which upserts document by a Unique Criteria.
