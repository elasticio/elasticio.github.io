## 2019-05-30 - v3.16.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| May 30th, 2019 | Platform release v3.16.0 |

### New Features

#### Performance Boosts

We have made quite a few performance-related improvements. Apart from general optimization of the platform this means that now *Flows* and *Designer* pages will work much faster. For once, we will not spam you with boring technical details on this one. You will see the difference.


#### Frontend

For your convenience we have set alphabetical ordering for the following:

-	Contracts switcher
-	Components list on *Credentials* page
-	Credentials list of a certain Component
-	Components list in Designer
-	Credentials of a certain Component in Designer
-	Component's functions list in Designer
-	Workspace members list
-	Contract members list
-	Workspaces list on the *Contract details* page
-	Developer Teams list on *Contract details* page
-	Repositories list on *Developer Team* page

Additionally, you can now open links in new tabs. You know, those you couldn't before, like: *Workspace* link in the left navigation bar, *Flow* link in the list of flows, *Next* and *Previous* links in execution log.

Also, some descriptions and messages are now more clear: mapping description for array mapping, limited Workspace text, etc. Some details [here](#frontend-stuff), if you require.

*Content-Based Router* component now shows branch setup directly after component selection on the first step.


#### Other

You can now filter data samples by ID in API endpoint `GET /v2/data-samples?filter[id]=id1,id2,..,idN`
An example is [here](#other-stuff).

If you're using *Content-Based Router* component, you'd be glad to know that it can now access passthrough.
**NOTE:** The new version of [Content-Based Router component](https://github.com/elasticio/router-component) needs to be applied to your installation.
Details [here](#other-stuff).

In the following gendry migration `2019-05-16-set-task-last-start-time.js` add `flow.lastStartTime` where it's not set. This is essential for the new functionality.


### Fixed Bugs

- Flows older than 1.5 years don't block Contract deletion any more, provided you run gendry migration `2019-05-02-set-task-currentStatus-for-deleted-status.js`

- Uppercase letters in Service Account username do not break login process anymore.


### Technical Stuff

**WARNING!** Boring technical stuff ahead. Read only if you have to.

#### Frontend stuff

*"Please, configure all steps in order to save the flow"* message replaced with alert. It shows in case of non-configured components in a flow.


#### Other Stuff

**FILTERING EXAMPLE:**

```
curl {{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/v2/data-samples?filter[id]={DATASAMPLE_ID1},{DATASAMPLE_ID2} \
  -u {EMAIL}:{APIKEY} \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

**EXAMPLE FOR CBR PASSTHROUGH:**

 Let's say that the first step of flow returns the following data in the sample:

```json
{
  "fireTime": "2634-02-27T12:50:29.603Z",
  "lastPoll": "2840-04-29T18:20:58.174Z"
}
```

If you want these values to be evaluated please use the following expressions:
`elasticio."step_1".body.fireTime` or `elasticio."step_1".body.lastPoll`

### New Features

#### Full and Limited Workspaces

Now there are two types of workspaces: `full` and `limited`. `Full` workspaces are well-known to you, so `limited` type is the new thing. Basically, in `limited` workspaces the workflows are set to stop automatically after a certain time period.

![](/assets/img/getting-started/contracts-and-workspaces/Screenshot_2.png)

`Limited` workspaces are mainly meant for trial periods. Check out more info about them [here](/getting-started/contracts-and-workspaces). By default, your workspaces will be `full`. Here are some more [technical details](#full-and-limited-workspaces-stuff) for those interested.



#### Contracts and Workspaces

There will be no more "stray" contracts, meaning that any contract will always have an Owner. The first member of a contract will automatically be assigned the role of Owner. Also, you cannot just leave the contract without "administration". If you're the last member, you can either delete the contract or terminate your account from the platform. As a general rule, if the last member is removed from the contract, the contract is deleted automatically. Check out the [technical details](#contracts-and-workspaces-stuff).

You can now rename workspaces in the UI. That is, if you have the right [permission](/guides/managing-user-roles-in-a-tenant), of course.

![](/assets/img/tenant-management-guide/managing-workspaces/rename-workspace.png)

As a casual improvement, you can now enjoy optimized internal [resource management](#contracts-and-workspaces-stuff) in contracts.


#### Other

All in all, we've made a few minor additions to improve performance. For example, we removed an entire tier of overhead by using pods instead of jobs for flows. While performance gain is not huge, all actions (retrieve sample, start/stop flow, etc.) are now faster, and this effect is cumulative.

Also, now user registration process is optimized. It works via
API calls instead of directly via Database, which is generally better and more secure.

You can find details [here](#other-stuff).


### Fixed Bugs

-  We updated JSONata versions used in the platform to `1.6.3`, so all associated processes will go smoothly. Don't forget to update mapper, router and JSONata-transform.


### Technical Stuff

**WARNING!** Boring technical stuff ahead. Read only if you have to.

#### Full and Limited Workspaces Stuff

To define `full` type as default, set `tenant.defaultWorkspaceType` to `full`.

There is a new *Wiper* script that handles limited workspaces. It is a job `stop-limited-flows` that periodically stops flows in limited workspaces. Also, we implemented a new API endpoint for *Wiper* to get flows that have to be stopped in limited workspaces. The response consists of an array of IDs of flows that require stopping. You can modify the TTL (Time to Live) of the limited flows by using the environment variable `LIMITED_WORKSPACE_FLOW_TTL_IN_MINUTES`. The default value is `10 minutes`.

The *Wiper* job `suspend-tasks-with-failing-containers` will stop failed flows in limited workspaces, instead of suspending them, as it does in the full workspaces.

#### Contracts and Workspaces Stuff

A user without owner role will not be added to empty contract via `POST /v2/:contract_id/invites` or `POST /v2/:contract_id/members` by default.
`POST /v2/contracts/:contract_id/members` will return `409` if contract has no members and `payload.role` doesn't contain owner.
`POST /v2/contracts/:contract_id/invites` will return `409` if contract has no members and `payload.role` doesn't contain owner.

To disable this effect you need to set environment variable `DISABLE_CONTRACT_MUST_HAVE_OWNER` to `"true"` into secret. After that it is possible to add member without owner role to empty contract.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
{
    "DISABLE_CONTRACT_MUST_HAVE_OWNER": "true"
}
```
**Note:** because of environment variables processing, the value `false` is being converted into a string (`"false"`) and considered as truthy value. In order to set the behavior back to defaults, it is better to remove this environment variable from the secret at all.

**To not create the default workspace**

The default Workspace won't be created in the following cases:

  1\. `POST` new member into the Contract.

  2\. Redeeming an invite.

  3\. New user registration.

  The page with **Create New Workspace** button will appear instead.

#### Other Stuff

Added/changed environment variables that control CPU and memory requests/limits.
Make sure the following environment variables are set:
```
COMPONENT_MEM_DEFAULT=256
COMPONENT_MEM_DEFAULT_LIMIT=256
COMPONENT_MEM_JAVA=512
COMPONENT_MEM_JAVA_LIMIT=512
COMPONENT_CPU=0.1
COMPONENT_CPU_LIMIT=1
```
All new pods in k8s are started with `ImagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`.

*Reset snapshot* function is disabled while the flow is running. You can reset snapshot only when the flow is stopped.


## 2019-04-04 - v3.14.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| April 4th, 2019 | Platform release v3.14.0 |

### New Features

#### *OAuth*

-   Introduced API endpoints for OAuth clients. Oauth client entity contains
    client ID and client secret for OAuth authorization. Find more info on OAuth clients [here](/guides/managing-oauth-clients).

-   Oauth client is defined in tenant per component. There may be several OAuth
    clients in different tenants for same component. **Note**: since OAuth
    client belongs to tenant, tenant removal means OAuth clients removal for
    this tenant.

-   In case a component was removed or hidden due to access change, OAuth client
    remains. However, no information about component is attached in responses.

-   Accessibility is calculated on tenant basis. So global components are
    recognized as accessible. If component tenant matches OAuth client tenant,
    components with `tenant` and `team` accesses are also recognized as
    accessible.

-   Blocked the ability to delete an OAuth client, which is used in the flow (or draft, or version).

-   Global OAuth components don't appear in `GET /v2/components` response until a Tenant Admin creates an OAuth Client for them.

-   Set OAuth client related environment variables on each step execution.

-   Reworked OAuth code of Frontend to get tenant-specific OAuth parameters from OAuth
    clients API. New service account is introduced. It's used by frontend to
    communicate with API. Login + pass pair is defined with the new environment variables:

     `FRONTEND_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME`

     `FRONTEND_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`.

     You should generate it any way you like (e.g. `pwgen -n 15 -y`) At this moment only `tenants.oauth_client.get` permission is granted to frontend service account.


#### *UI*

-   Number of workspaces shown on the left menu is now limited by browser
    height.

-   Added tooltips to the **Plus** button starting from the second step of the
    flow. *"Add the initial trigger"* and *"Add a new action"* hints.

-   Added tooltip explaining why the user cannot publish a draft. *"Please
    complete all steps first"* message is displayed next to the Publish Draft
    icon.

-   Changed tooltip for **Create Draft** button to *"Edit Flow"*.
    **Note:** changes will not affect the flow until you publish edited draft message is now
    appeared.

#### *Other*

-  All numeric log object properties are converted to strings to avoid the following Graylog parsing errors:
`{"type":"mapper_parsing_exception","reason":"failed to parse
[err_code]","caused_by":{"type":"number_format_exception","reason":"For
input string: \"string\""}}` for platform apps logs.

-   To avoid `MapperParsingException[failed to parse [err_code]]; nested:
    NumberFormatException[For input string: "INVALID_PARAM"]`. Parsing JSON of
    components' log messages removed from Graylog input and is done in-place on
    frontend.
    Deployment instructions: Remove all extractors for Graylog GEL input
    named `"Input for flow steps and one-time execs"`. This should be done after
    instructions for Route platform app logs to own `GELF input -> stream ->
    index`.

-   Removed `contract.membership.edit` permission from `contract.admin` role. So
    that he/she could not change roles of Contract members.

-   New input field type RegExp (Regular Expression). Field object in
    *component.json* should have the next property in order to validate it as a
    regular expression field `"type": "regexp"`.

-   All wiper Cron job descriptors were changed - `“startingDeadlineSeconds”: 200` added.

-   Tenant admin can now include the custom *.js* and *.css* files in order
    to be able to change the behavior/appearance of the platform. Tenant model
    needs to accept the following new properties:

```
"customStylesheets": [
  {"href": "http://path-to-1.css"},
  {"href": "http://path-to-2.css"},
  ...
],
"customScripts": [
  {"src": "http://path-to-1.js"},
  {"src": "http://path-to-2.js"},
  ...
]
```


-   Workspace owner can rename workspace via API request.

-   Implemented statistics collector for one-time-executions.

-   CSS improved for custom tenant styles.

-   Unused samples will be deleted after choosing the definite sample.

-   Route platform app logs to own GELF input -\> stream -\> index. Added
    ability to send log messages of flow steps and one-time-execs (verify
    credentials, dynamic metadata, dynamic select model) to separate GELF input
    in Graylog. This allows applying own extractors configuration and logs
    records retention policies.

**End of Instructions**


### Fixed Bugs


-  **FIXED** excessively long text in Configure input section is overlaid table border in
    retrieved sample.

-  **FIXED** broken API docs start page when there is no slash at the end of the URL.
    /docs/v2/ is the new start page now.
