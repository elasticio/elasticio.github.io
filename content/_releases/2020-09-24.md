## Improvements and Updates

### Lower recipes visibility

With this release we enabled lowering the recipe visibility using an API call.
To lower the visibility use the `/v2/recipes/{RECIPE_ID}/visibility` API endpoint.
Check our [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-recipe-visibility) for exact API call format.

To remind, the visibility can be `workspace`, `contract` and `tenant`. The `workapace`
is the lowest visibility. Please note the following before trying to lower the visibility:

*   You can change the visibility only if you have appropriate permission. This includes lowering or increasing the access.
*   After lowering the recipe visibility it will not be available for other users who have no access to the entity.

### Define recipe author

We extended the recipe creation API to include the `author` attribute as well.
*   If this attribute is set in your recipe creation API call, then this value will be displayed in the UI.
*   Otherwise, the default logic would apply - the full name of the API caller will be taken as value.

Here is an example section of the recipe draft:

```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "recipe",
    "attributes": {
      "info": {
        "title": "My simple recipe",
        "author":"THE AUTHOR OF RECIPE NAME IS LOCATED HERE",
        "short_description": "The short description text is here",
        "description": "Long description text goes here."
      },
```

### Polling flows starting conditions

With this release we improved the conditions when the polling flows start after
you update and publish the draft which replaces the active flow.

When you publish a new draft over the active flow it would not trigger a new
execution, but will wait and run it on next due execution time.

> Please note: If you need to execute your flow right away you can always press **Run now** to do so.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixes the search functionality in "Choose Agent" drop-down of the new mapper interface.
*   Addresses the problem of frozen retrieve sample state for edge cases.
*   Fixes the bug when step configuration gets blocked after component version change.
*   Addresses the problem when Secrets service fails to refresh the OAuth2 tokens.
*   Fixes the bug when the redirect URL hash gets removed after the login.
