## Improvements and Updates

Talk about improvements and updates in general.

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Configure login attempts

Now you can configure the number of failed login attempts your users can have before
locking them out of the system. We added a new variable `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` to the
HELM3 secrets chart. Set this variable any reasonable number for your system, otherwise
it defaults to 5. Here is how we calculate this number:

*   In case you don't have 2FA enabled, this is the number of failed login attempts.
*   In case you have 2FA enabled, this is combined number of failed 2FA code and login attempts. This means if your user has 2FA enabled and succeeded with login but failed with 2FA more than the value of `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` then your user will be locked out of the system. To unlock such users the tenant administration must first disable 2FA for this user and then remove the field `failedLoginsCount` from the user object in the database.


## OEM Related

News in this section are for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Removing docker registry builds on component deletion

The platform builds a component docker image every time you push a new version of
your component. When you remove the component or a particular version of it from
the platform, an associated docker build would remain until you would remove it at
later stage directly from the docker registry.

With platform {{page.version}} we improved the situation in the following way:
*   When you remove a version of your component, the platform removes the associated docker build.
*   When you remove your component entirely, the platform removes all builds of your component.
*   We created a special tool to help cleanup the remnant builds. Get in touch with us to get a copy of it.
*   As OEM customer: You must configure your own docker registry to [enable delete images option](https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#delete).
*   As OEM customer: You must know of that the deletion from docker registry does not free the memory automatically. To free the memory you would need to run the [garbage collector](https://docs.docker.com/registry/garbage-collection/) job.
