## Improvements and Updates

### Continued improvements

Here we should talk about the automated vulnerabilities checks of our code.

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

### Scalability of services

elastic.io platform runs many services under the hood like `webhooks`, `api`, `frontend`, etc.
Most of these services can and must run in replication meaning they can be scalled to suit
the needs and the load. Some services, however, do not support scalability due to
their nature. In this update we removed possibility to define scalability for `bloodyGate`
and `handmaiden` services from the HELM3 charts configurations.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Contract level custom metadata

We introduce a new possibility to add a custom metadata to the contracts. A new
section called `custom_data` can be used to store non-sensitive string data up-to 1MB in
size. To add, edit and read contract custom metadata you need to have
`contracts.contract.edit_custom_data` permission (`tenantAdmin` has this permission
by default) to perform `POST`, `PATCH` and `GET` calls to the `/v2/contract` API endpoint.

{% endif %}

## Fixed bugs

*   We corrected the error type for the `PATCH` call to `/v2/flows/{FLOW_ID}` when invalid team name in the command parameter and invalid trigger/action name in the command parameter were given. Now you will get `4xx` type error instead of `5xx` which better reflects the situation.
