## Features

### Automated component deployments

In platform version {{page.version}} we are releasing the new automated
component deployment feature. We introduced the underlying concept with the version
[22.04](/releases/22/04.html#component-deployments-via-docker-images) release at
the end of January 2022. Here is the final workflow of the automated component
deployments:

1.  A new version (`tag`) is created in the GitHub component repository and the release is published.
2.  The CircleCI build process uses `appbuilder` + `apprunner` images.
3.  A Docker image of the component is built with the `tag` version and submitted to Dockerhub.
4.  An additional `latest` version is created in Dockerhub each time the code is updated.
5.  The platform runs a Kubernetes platform job called `components-pusher` at certain intervals checking the component Dockerhub `latest` version.
6.  If the version in Dockerhub differs from the existing platform version it pulls a new Docker image and pushes it into the platform docker registry.
7.  A new version of component is released for the platform users and can be selected while designing flows.

> **Please Note** - we determine and set the configuration of platform `components-pusher` in HELM3 deployment
> charts. These configurations provide more options for each component. Here we present the typical scenario.

The automated component deployment process works along with the old git-push
workflow. You can push components via git receiver as well. The `components-pusher` will not
interfere with your pushed version.

## Improvements and Updates

### Node.js Sailor version `2.6.27`

We released a new version (`2.6.27`) of the Node.js Sailor library version. This
version includes an `npm` audit to CI and updated dependencies.

### UX Improvements: credentials page

To improve the user experience on the credentials page we added the component
team and repository name to which this credential belongs. This helps in
distinguishing between different deployments of components and in choosing the correct
component for credential modification.

The above images show two different repositories of the same component.
The new improvement shows the difference between these two components.

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Configure password length and rules

With platform version {{page.version}} we introduce a new configuration to set the
login password length and the requirements. The following variables have been
added to HELM3 charts:

*   `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` - the user password must have at least this number of symbols,
*   `MIN_PASSWORD_RULES_MATCHES` - number of minimum different character groups (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols) should be matched

### Session timeout configuration

To provide more granular control for session timeout and distinguish between `idle`
and `absolute` timeouts we introduce new configurations and deprecate the `COOKIE_MAX_AGE`
environment variable. The `idle` and `absolute` timeouts follow definitions described
in the [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#automatic-session-expiration). We also introduce the HELM3 configuration variables to control values
for these new timeouts:

*   `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` - default: 24 hours - replaces `COOKIE_MAX_AGE`,
*   `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT` - default: `2` times the `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

{% endif %}

## Fixed bugs

*   Addressed the issue when the "Server error" message would show while navigating through the UI upon the session expiration.
*   Fixed the bug causing the system to erroneously send "New sign-in to your account" emails. The expired sessions were not deleted from the system.
*   Addressed the issue with the "Mapping" configuration field showing up in UI for the trigger functions on components.

## Components

With introduction of automated component pusher we change the standardise component
build procedures preparing them for `components-pusher` service. The following component
build configurations were changed:

*   [Shopify Admin Component](/components/shopify/) `1.5.0`

### GraphQL component `1.1.1`

*   **ADDED** `No Auth`, `Basic Auth` and `API Key Auth` authentication methods
*   **ADDED** a new action `Raw Request`
*   **ADDED** a new action `Configured Request`

### [Shopify admin component](/components/shopify-admin/) `1.5.0`

*   **ADDED:** a new action `Update Inventory Level`
*   **FIXED** the output metadata for `Get New And Updated Objects Polling` trigger

### PayPal component `1.0.0`
