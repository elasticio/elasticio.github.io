## Features

### Automated component deployments

With the platform version {{page.version}} we are releasing the new automated
component deployment feature. We introduced the underlying concept with the
[22.04](/releases/22/04.html#component-deployments-via-docker-images) release in
the end of January 2022. Here is the final workflow of the automated component
deployments:

1.  New version (`tag`) is created in the GitHub component repository and the release is published.
2.  CircleCI build process uses `appbuilder` + `apprunner` images.
3.  Docker image of the component is built with the `tag` version and submitted into the Dockerhub.
4.  An additional `latest` version is created at Dockerhub side each time code is updated.
5.  Platform runs a Kubernetes platform job called `component-pusher` at certain intervals checking the component Dockerhub `latest` version.
6.  If the version in Dockerhub differs from the platform existing version then it pulls new Docker image and pushes into platform docker registry.
7.  A new version of component is released for the platform users and can be selected while designing the flows.

> **Please Note** - we determine and set the configuration of platform `component-pusher` in HELM3 deployment
> charts. These configurations provide more options for each component. Here we present the typical scenario.

The automated component deployment process works along with the old git-push
workflow. You can push components via git receiver as well. Component-pusher will not
interfere with your pushed version.

## Improvements and Updates

### Node.js Sailor version `2.6.27`

We released a new version (`2.6.27`) of the Node.js Sailor library version. This
version includes an `npm` audit to CI and updated dependencies.

### UX Improvements: credentials page

To improve the user experience on the credentials page we added the component
team and repository name to which this credential belongs to. This way you can
distinguish between different deployments of components and choose the correct
component for the credential modification.

 Picture above shows two different repositories of the same component. Without
 the new improvement it would have been impossible to distinguish between two
 since both use the same component icon.

 ## HELM3

 We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaborations
 with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Configure password length and rules

With platform version {{page.version}} we introduce new configuration to set the
login password length and the rules. With the new configurations we introduce the
following variables to HELM3 charts:

*   `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` - the user password must have at least this number of symbols,
*   `MIN_PASSWORD_RULES_MATCHES` - number of minimum different character groups (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols) should be matched

## Fixed bugs

*   Addressed the issue when the "Server error" message would show while navigating through the UI upon the session expiration.
*   Fixed the bug causing the system to erroneously send "New sign-in to your account" emails. The expired sessions were not deleted from the system.
*   Addressed the issue with the "Mapping" configuration field showing up in UI for the trigger functions on components.
