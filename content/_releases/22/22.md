## Improvements and Updates

### Re-authentication for sensitive actions (continuation)

This is the continuation of our effort to prevent accidental change or deletion
of sensitive information. The first part was completed during the
[22.20](/releases/22/20#re-authentication-for-sensitive-actions) platform release.

This time we extend the list of actions for which you will be asked to enter your
password to authenticate:

*   Change user roles in Contracts and Workspaces.
*   Add or remove SSH Keys.
*   Remove member from Contract.

> **Again, please note**: You will be asked to re-authenticate once every 6 hours.

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).



### Email verification with regular signup page

During the 20.20 platform release we introduced [email verification process](/releases/22/20#email-verification-during-registration) which worked only when the [`signin_v_2` were used](/releases/22/20#setup-email-verification).

Now you can use the email verification process even if you are using a regular
signup page in your tenant. To enable this feature in your tenant the following
steps must be done using an [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#update-a-tenant)
to update your tenant records using `tenantAdmin` privileges:

*   Enable the registration page - set the `attributes.hide_register` parameter to `false`.
*   Enable `email_verification` feature flag - set `attributes.feature_flags.email_verification` to `true`.
