## Features

### Recipes list: Frontend

!!!NOT FINISHED!!!

We are introdusing a new page Recipes inside the Integrate section. On this page you can see all available recipes with their deployments.
Single recipe page include tab for activation recipe and tab with recipe's deployments. You can remove your deployments itselfs or including flows. Also you can sync your flows if connected recipes were updated.

## Improvements

### New flow designer graph UI

!!!NOT FINISHED!!!

We continue to improve our Designer Page. Now when you create or change a flow you will notice new uniform design - components in flow displaying inside squares instead of circles.

We have also updated designer page graph - now it uses react portal.
