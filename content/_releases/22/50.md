## Features

### Recipes list: Use Interface

In this release we introduce a new dedicated page for recipe management accessible
through new Recipes menu item available under Integrate section. Now you can find
all recipes cards available to you similar to the flows page.

You can use all listed recipes to create an integration flow by pressing **Activate**
button. If the recipes is already used in a flow deployment, the counter for Recipes
Deployments will show number of flows using this recipe. You can even get list of flows
created from this recipes by pressing **Show Deployments**.

You can click on a recipe card to open a dedicated recipe page which includes two
pages accessible through the **activation** and **deployments** tabs on the top.
The activation page shows standard information about the recipe. The deployments
page lists all connected flows created from this recipe.

From here you can:
*   Open the flows if you have access to it.
*   Update the flow using a new recipe version if available.
*   Delete the flow created from the recipe.
*   Delete the connection between flow and recipe.


## Improvements

### New flow designer graph UI

We continue to improve our Designer Page. Now when you create or change a flow
you will notice new uniform design - components in flow displaying inside squares
instead of circles.

We have also updated designer page graph - now it uses react portal.
