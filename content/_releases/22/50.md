## Features

### Recipes list: Use Interface

In this release we introduce a new dedicated page for recipe management accessible
through new Recipes menu item available under Integrate section. Now you can find
all recipes cards available to you similar to the flows page.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2250/rn2250-recipes.png" title="Recipes" %}

You can use all listed recipes to create an integration flow by pressing **Activate**
button. If the recipes is already used in a flow deployment, the counter for Recipes
Deployments will show number of flows using this recipe. You can get list of flows
created from this recipes by pressing **Show Deployments**.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2250/rn2250-recipe-card.png" title="Recipe Card" %}

You can click on a recipe title on the card to open a dedicated recipe section
which includes **Recipe** and **Deployments** pages accessible through the tabs on
the top. The **Recipe** page contains information about the recipe. From here you
can can press Activate to create a flow based on this recipe.

> **Please Note: we changed the access URL of single recipe page.** Now it
> contains the contract ID and has the following form:
> `{base_url}/c/{contract_id}/w/{workspace_id}/recipes/{recipe_id}`

If you have used this recipe before to create a flow, the **Deployments** page will
list them all.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2250/rn2250-recipe-deployments.png" title="Recipe Deployments" %}

From here you can:
*   Open the flows if you have access to it.
*   **Upgrade** the flow using a new recipe version if available.
*   **Delete** the recipe deployment - severing the connection between flow and recipe.
*   **Delete With Flows** - deleting the recipe deployment with the associated flows (one recipe deployment can contain more than one flow).

## Improvements

### New flow designer graph UI

We continue to improve our Designer Page. Now when you create or change a flow
you will notice new uniform design - components in flow displaying inside squares
instead of circles.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2250/rn2250-new-flowsteps-design.png" title="New flowsteps design" %}

We have also updated designer page graph - now it uses react portal.
