## Improvements and Updates

### Per-tenant frontend styles feature removed

We've removed feature that builds per-tenant styles and applied them based on `tenant.cssEnabled` and `tenant.code property`. We also removed all tenant styles from our codebase.

> PLease visit our [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#tenants) for more information.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Support new component builder for java components

We are introducing a new `сomponent-build-helper` version `0.1.0`. It also means that the old appbuilder is totally deprecated and is no longer supported. We have added custom dockerfile support for Java components.

> **Please Note:** For now our new component builder supports Java 8 based components only.

### Check for vulnerabilities after build using grype

Component vulnerabilities check in the build docker image is done by `сomponent-build-helper` during component build process. Components-build-helper has `build_component_docker` command which checks docker image vulnerabilities using grype tool.

> For more information please visit our article on Components build configuration requirements.

## Fixed bugs

* Fixed bug where status page is not exposed at React pages if any maintenance is active. We added property "location" ("head" or "body", default: "head") into `tenant.customScripts`.

* Fixed `mailchimp.subscribeUse`. Removed mailchimp properties from tenants and keys from api docs.
