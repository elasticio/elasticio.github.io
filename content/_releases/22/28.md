## Improvements and Updates

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

###   Add Ability to Set Per-Service Custom Ingress Annotations

To increase the flexibility of in ingress configurations for different hosts we made a **breaking change**. We have changed the structure of the model properties `tenant.ingressConfig.annotations` and `helm.Values.global.services.handmaiden.annotations`. Please be **aware** that upgrading to elastic.io Tenants to this latest version requires the small changes described below:

  * `tenant.ingress_config.annotations` format changed. This parameter must be reset via API call before updating to the latest version. Please use this API call:

```json
  {
     "data": {
         "type": "tenant",
         "attributes": {
             "ingress_config": {}
             }
  }
}
```

  * `global.services.handmaiden.annotations` HELM variable format changed, please set it to the new format during upgrade

 Here you can see the corresponding code for PATCH v2/tenants endpoint:

                     },
                     "api": {
                         "nginx/123": "123",
                         "nginx/456": "456"
                     },
                     "webhooks": {

                         "nginx/456": "456"
                     },
                     "apidocs": {
                         "nginx/mtls": "true",

                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
 }
 ```

### Add "--push-retry" option to kaniko.

 To improve push behaviour we added `--push-retry` and made this configurable only via gitreceiver (deafult: 3). Please setup using `.Values.global.gitReceiver.dockerImageBuildJobPushRetry`.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Support new component builder for java components

We are introducing a new `сomponent-build-helper` [version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic.io/component-build-helper) `0.1.0`. It also means that the old appbuilder is totally deprecated and is no longer supported. We have added custom dockerfile support for Java components.

> **Please Note:** For now our new component builder supports Java 8 based components only.

### Check for vulnerabilities after build using grype

Component vulnerabilities check in the build docker image is done by `сomponent-build-helper` during component build process. Components-build-helper has `build_component_docker` command which checks docker image vulnerabilities using grype tool.

> For more information please visit our [article](/developers/component-build-configuration) on Components build configuration requirements.

## Fixed bugs

* The status page will now be displayed during maintenance on React pages. The property "location" ("head" or "body", default: "head") has been added to `tenant.attributes.customScripts`.
