## Improvements

### Component repositories: New design & improved functionality

We continue to update our User Interface to improve ease of use. This time it is
the UI of every component repository that is updated. When you navigate to
Development > Developer Teams > Random component your team you will notice new
uniform design:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2244/RN2244-repository-view.png" title="Component repositories: New design Inside" %}

From each component repository page you can navigate to the environment variables
page where you can add new, change or delete the existing environment variables
for the component:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2244/RN2244-repository-env-vars.png" title="Component repositories: environment variables" %}


{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}


## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

### RabbitMQ HAProxy in kubernetes cluster

The HAProxy for RabbitMQ cluster will now run as a separate service in the platform
kubernetes cluster instead of dedicated single virtual machine. This enables
high-availability and scalability by running the service in a replica set.

To run the HAProxy for the RabbitMQ cluster, change the following parameters in
the HELM3 charts:

*   Update all HELM3 variables pointing to HAProxy VM to `haproxy-service.platform.svc.cluster.local`.
*   Introduce a new HELM3 configuration file `haproxy.yaml` with the following content:
```yaml
haproxy:
      rabbitmqNodeIps:
        rabbitmq: "10.28.0.4"
        rabbitmq-2: "10.28.0.65"
```
Where `rabbitmq` and `rabbitmq-2` parameters must match the RabbitMQ cluster VM
names and values to their VM IP addresses.

> **Please Note**: You must first deploy the HAProxy chart before the platform version deployment.

## Fixed bugs

*   Fixed the user interface bug when flow status changes were not reflected on the flows page.
*   Addressed the problem when removing the user from the workspace or contract would take more than 4 minutes. Now the process takes less than a second.
*   Fixed the bug when API would return `5xx` error when you use a space in the repository name while creating a component repository. Now the UI will disable the save button and show en error message `Repository name contains invalid characters. Letters, digits, - and _ are allowed only`
*   Addressed the bug when identity keys page (SSH Keys) would not load in case when a key without title were saved previously. Now the title is a required field:
    *   You must provide an SSH Key title to save the key.
    *   The system will also attempt to use the user title if present in the SSH Key body.
