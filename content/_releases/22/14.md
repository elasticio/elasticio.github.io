## Improvements and Updates

### Step designer: Sample data part

We have improved the sample data retrieval to provide a more unified user experience
during flow design. The look and feel is now more in line with our new approach.

![Step designer: Sample Data part](/assets/img/RN/2214/step-designer-sample-data-initial.png)


The above images show the new Sample data retrieval view. This release {{page.version}}
adds new functionality, allowing users to skip sample generation by clicking on
the **Skip Sample** button. When this function is used the platform will add an
empty JSON `{}` instead of the Sample data.

When you retrieve the Sample the platform UI will show it only in JSON format. In
{{page.version}} we removed the Integrator view of Data Sample.

![Step designer: Sample data retrieved](/assets/img/RN/2214/step-designer-sample-data-result.png)

Here you can view the Sample, collapse different sections of the JSON data
structure and edit it.

### Quota usage page improvements

To show the RAM quota overuse we improved the quota **Usage History** histogram.
If you go over the set RAM quota value the overused part will show in red.

### SSH Keys and SSH 8.8

To support the newest SSH versions we deprecated the old `ssh-dss` signature and
we added `ssh-ed25519` instead. Now when you upload your SSH key to our platform
you will see the information about the supported types of signatures.

![SSH Key upload screen](/assets/img/RN/2214/ssh-signatures.png)

**Please Note** the old `ssh-rsa` keys are still supported. If you want to use
them you have two options:

1.  Use an OpenSSH `8.8+` client and generate your SSH Key using the `-oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa` parameter. It will generate an `RSA+SHA-2` type SSH key which provides a high level of security and works with the OpenSSH `8.8+` clients.
2.  Use an OpenSSH `<=8.7` client to generate your SSH Key.

### Flow deletion times

The platform {{page.version}} includes new capability to hard-delete the flows
after an **expiration time** set by the platform management. Every time you try to
delete the flow a warning message will show with the following text:

> Are you sure you want to delete "FLOW NAME" flow permanently? Deleting this
> flow is an irreversible process, we cannot undo a deletion if you complete
> the process by accident. Please note that the credentials linked with the flow
> will not be deleted.


{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Changes to `cadvisor` and `fluentd` demons

To enable better coexistence of platform microservices within the multi-service
Kubernetes clusters, we modified the logic used to run `cadvisor` and `fluentd` services.
The platform will run these services when the node has uniquely defined selectors.

To achieve this we introduced a new HELM3 configuration for the node labels for the
Kubernetes pod allocation.

```yaml
global:
  nodeSelectors:
    platform: "platform"
    longRunningTask: "longrunning"
    ordinaryTask: "ordinary"
```

For these changes to take affect we deprecate the following HELM3 configurations:

*   `KUBERNETES_ORDINARY_LABEL_VALUE`
*   `KUBERNETES_LONG_RUNNING_LABEL_VALUE`

These variables ware removed from the secrets HELM3 chart and are no longer used
by the `admiral` service starting from {{page.version}} release. Please use
`Values.global.nodeSelectors` platform HELM3 chart configuration instead.

*   The `cadvisor` service will run on the nodes with `longRunningTask` and `ordinaryTask` labels.
*   The `fluentd` service will run on the nodes with `platform`, `longRunningTask` and `ordinaryTask` labels.

### Richer Ingress Management

To extend the Ingress setup capability we made changes in the `Handmaiden microservice`
to provide 2 new ways to provide annotations to the Ingress records. With this new
capability you can set unique Ingress values per each tenant in your cluster.

1.  [Set in the HELM3 chart](#set-helm3-configuration).
2.  [Set per tenant using an API call](#setting-via-api-call).

#### Set HELM3 configuration

You can set the Ingress values directly in your HELM3 chart like:

```yaml
global:
  services:
    handmaiden:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: 'nginx'
        testAnnotation: 'testValue'
```

If you set the above configuration the platform passes it to the new environment
variable `INGRESS_OPERATOR_ANNOTATIONS` used by the Handmaiden service. This adds
Ingress annotations to all tenants in your multi-tenant cluster.

#### Setting via API call

You can set unique Ingress annotations for each tenant using the new configuration
[while creating the tenant]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#create-a-tenant) via
an API call. A typical call body could look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tenant",
    "attributes": {
      "ingress_config" : {
        "annotations": {
          "annotationName": "value"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Annotation Priorities

Our platform will serves these annotations based on priority of annotation
the configurations (from low to high):

*   Default Ingress annotations,
*   Annotations provided in the INGRESS_OPERATOR_ANNOTATIONS environment variable,
*   Annotations, provided for the tenant using API call,
*   Static, hard-coded annotations.


### Flow deletion job

Introducing a new cron job called `clear-deleted-flows` which permanently deletes
flows from the MongoDB with the `DELETED` status. Every user trying to delete a
flow will see a [warning message](#flow-deletion-times) informing that this is a
permanent and irreversible action.

#### HELM3 optional variables

We introduce new environment variables which you can use to control the
`clear-deleted-flows` job:

*   `WIPER_CLEAR_DELETED_FLOWS_AGE_SECONDS` - Time in seconds the job must wait before deleting the flow permanently after it is marked as `DELETED` in MongoDB. We set the default value to `86400` seconds (1 day).
*   `WIPER_CLEAR_DELETED_FLOWS_LIMIT` - Maximum number of flows the `clear-deleted-flows` job will permanently delete each time it runs.

#### Release process

This release process applies if you already have a cluster running previous versions
of the platform code. **The {{page.number}} release will start an automatic migration.**

*   Backup the MongoDB data base before the deployment to have an opportunity to reverse the process.
*   Set `WIPER_CLEAR_DELETED_FLOWS_LIMIT` environment variable to an applicable number for your case to perform this operation faster of you have large number of flows in your DB.

> After the migration the `marathonevents`, `requestbins` and `taskstartlogs`
> deprecated collection will be removed.

### Iron Bank table creation on all Clickhouse instances

New Environment Variables:

*   `IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_NODES` (required) - array of objects with host (required), port, user and password values
*   `IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE` (optional) - ClickHouse database name (default iron_bank)

```yaml
IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_NODES:
   - host: "10.0.0.1"
     port: "8123"
     user: "default"
     password: "123"
   - host: "10.0.0.2"
     port: "8123"
     user: "user"
     password: "1234"
IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE: "iron_bank"
```

New Iron Bank provision logic

*   If all nodes in `IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_NODES` are not available, an error is thrown and iron bank shuts down
*   If one of the nodes is not available, a warning is logged and provision to all other available nodes is executed
*   The main connection (to which all querying is executed) is set to the first available node from `IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_NODES`

Removed Environment Variables:

`IRON_BANK_CLICKHOUSE_URI`


{% endif %}

## Fixed bugs

*   Addressed issue when the platform token refresher service would return `500` status code in case when the `/refresh/[id]` Oauth server would return an error. Now the service reports `4xx` indicating the third party problem.
*   Fixed the bug connected with the Profile Page usage example returning `401` in case of API-Key regeneration.
