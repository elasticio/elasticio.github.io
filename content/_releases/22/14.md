## Improvements and Updates

### Step designer: Sample data part

To provide a unified experience during the flow step design, we improved the Sample
data retrieval section. The look and feel is now more in line with our new
minimalist approach.

The above images show the new Sample data retrieval view. The release {{page.version}}
add a new functionality, now you can skip the sample generation by clicking on
the **Skip Sample** button. The platform will add an empty JSON `{}` instead of
the Sample data.

When you retrieve the Sample the platform UI will show it only in JSON format. In
{{page.version}} version we removed the Integrator view of Data Sample.

Here you can view the Sample, collapse different sections of the JSON data
structure and edit it.

### Quota usage page improvements

To show the RAM quota overuse we improved the quota **Usage History** histogram.
If you go over the the set RAM quota value the overused part will show in red.

### SSH Keys

To support the newest SSH versions we deprecated the old `ssh-dss` signature and
we added `ssh-ed25519` instead. Now when you upload your SSH key to our platform
you will see the information about the supported signatures.

> **Please Note** the old `ssh-rsa` keys are still supported.

### Flow deletion times

The platform {{page.version}} includes new capability to hard-delete the flows
after an **expiration time** set by the platform management. Every time you try to
delete the flow a warning message will show with the following text:

> Are you sure you want to delete "FLOW NAME" flow permanently? Deleting this
> flow is an irreversible process, we cannot undo a deletion if you complete
> the process by accident. Please note that the credentials linked with the flow
> will not be deleted.
