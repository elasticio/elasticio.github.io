## Improvements and Updates

### Not enough quota to start task

If you are one of power users of our platform you might have noticed a pop-up warning
with a message **Not enough quota to start task** once or twice. In reality this
had nothing to do with the set quota values of your contract. It happened when you
tried to start a realtime flow with more than 25-30 steps. Our platform starts steps
one after the other and sometimes fails to do so within the designated interval causing this error.

We addressed the situation by:

*   Starting the realtime flow pods in parallel, greatly improving the starting speed.
*   Changing the warning message to **The flow FLOW NAME (FLOW ID) is taking longer than expected to transition**.

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## OEM Related

News in this section are for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Enforce 2FA use

Tenant administration can now enforce the 2FA during the login. We introduce a
tenant configuration flag called `forced_totp` to switch this feature on.

*   To enable `forced_totp` you must enable the `enabled_totp` as well.
*   If you remove the `enabled_totp` feature flag, system will remove `forced_totp` as well.

You can set these parameters either during the [tenant creation]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#create-a-tenant) or
[update the parameters]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#update-a-tenant)
of existing tenant via an API call following this example JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tenant",
    "attributes":{
      "feature_flags": {
        "enabled_totp" : true,
        "forced_totp" : true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

From {{page.version}} version, the platform checks status of the `forced_totp`
parameter during your navigation of every page in the UI. If tenant administration
enforced the 2FA and you have not enabled the 2FA for your account then you will
be redirected to your profile page and presented a pop-up form to enable the 2FA.

{% endif %}
