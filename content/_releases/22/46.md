## Improvements

### Mapper can now map objects in hierarchies

The mapper User Interface (UI) now supports the mapping of objects, including
their sub-structures.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2246/RN2246-object-mapping.gif" title="Object mapping" %}

You can map object sub-structures like before by clicking on the arrow right
beside the component icon. You can also click on the name of the component to map
the entire object. This is also true for objects inside the objects. Click on the
object name to include it in the mapping.

## Updates

### Component builder helper `2.0.1`

We released the new version of the component builder helper, `2.0.1`. It can now
process custom Dockerfiles.
