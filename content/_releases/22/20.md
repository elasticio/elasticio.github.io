## Improvements and Updates

### Re-authentication for sensitive actions

While working on the platform user interface we try to click our way through
setup options and there is a chance we might accidentally remove a sensitive data.
There can be also cases when your account might be compromised and somebody would
deliberately try to cause harm.

For such cases we introduce re-authentication for sensitive actions. After
{{page.version}} for the following actions you will be asked to enter your password
to authenticate:

*   Reading, copying and regenerating your API Keys.
*   Modifying your user details.
*   Disabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).
*   Inviting members to contract.
*   Inviting and removing members from workspaces.

> **Please Note**: You will be asked to re-authenticate once every 6 hours.

### Email verification during registration

To prevent erroneous and bot registrations we introduce email verification step to
our registration process. When you register first time with our platform, an email
will be sent to your given email address. Click on the link in your received email
to finish your registration. There are certain rules and restrictions to this process as well:

*   If you register using Single-Sign-on (SSO) Provider (OIDC/SAML) then platform will not ask to verify your email address since you have verified it with your provider.
*   You must wait for 30 minutes before you can use the same email address to register.
*   The invitation to confirm your email is valid only for 1 day.

> **Please Note**: If you are invited to the platform directly, no email verification will be required.

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Separate MongoDB for Maester

When your integration flow needs to transfer big objects or attachments, one of
the platform microservices called Maester temporary stores them in MongoDB while
passing only the object IDs through the integration flow steps.

Starting from {{page.version}}, you can use a dedicated database for storing Maester
objects and the run-time attachments. To configure, add `MAESTER_MONGO_URI`
environment variable to HELM3 secrets charts and set it to target this new database.

> Note: You will need to migrate the grids to new MongoDB as well to ensure the Maester
> object availability after implementation.

If you don't need to use a separate MongoDB to store Maester object set
the `MAESTER_MONGO_URI` variable the same value as the `MONGO_URI` variable. This
will save objects in your main database.

### Sensitive action re-authentication

To configure the [re-authentication for sensitive actions](#re-authentication-for-sensitive-actions):
*   Add the `SENSITIVE_ACTION_AUTH_LIFETIME` environment variable to HELM3 secrets chart and set it to much your requirements to control how often your users must re-authenticate for sensitive actions. The system expect the value of this parameter in **milliseconds**. The default is set to `21600000` (6 hours).
*   Enable the `tenant.featureFlags.sensitiveActionsReauth` feature flag (set it `true`).

### White-labeled credential management

Integration projects for enterprise or retail solutions can become complex since there is a
need to connect multiple endpoints within the company ecosystem. This complexity,
oftentimes, dictates a certain rules of engagement like restricted access to the
systems. On the other hand, unrestricted access to these system is essential for
integration solution.

From one side we have the need for integration and other side, the need for security.
Often times, the team developing the integration is not the same team holding the
access to these systems. To solve the dilemma we introduce **White-labeled credential management**
feature.

#### How does the White-labeled credential management work?

As integrator you provide a unique URL to the credential holder to enter their access credentials without
registering or logging-in to the system. The access holder is presented an interface
to enter their credentials, verify them and save.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2220/RN2220-create-credential.png" title="OEM Create Credential" %}

They can also modify the existing credentials as well.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2220/RN2220-modify-credentials.png" title="OEM Modify Credentials" %}

For both cases they are presented with a simple screen to work with only the
specified credentials.

#### How to generate unique URL?

There are certain preconditions before you can make this work:

*   The end customer is already in the DB. This means you have to [create a user]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#create-a-user) for your credential holder, then [add him/her to the contract]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#add-a-new-member-to-the-contract's-scope) and [workspace]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#add-a-new-member-to-workspace) where the integration is set. All these actions you can do with API calls using administrative access.
*   New created user must have only access to the credentials entity.
*   Your tenant has SSO provider (OIDC/SAML) with `autoCreateUsers` set to `false` configuration.

If the above preconditions are in place then here is how you can generate the URL
to give to your credential holder.

The initial URL has a form `/embedded-credentials/repoId` where the `repoId`
would be the ID of component for which you need to set the credential. Then you
would need to add the following query parameters to this URL:

*   `workspaceId` (required) - this is the ID of the workspace where integration is set.
*   `ssoProviderType` (optional) - values can be `SAMLProvider` or `OIDCProvider`.
*   `ssoProviderId` (optional) - this is the ID of your SSO provider.

Let us construct the URL:
`TENANT_URL/embedded-credentials/[repoId]?workspaceId=[workspaceId]&ssoProviderType=[ssoProviderType]&ssoProviderId=[ssoProviderId]`

If you do not specify `ssoProviderType` and `ssoProviderId` then they will be
taken from the `tenant.loginRedirectSsoProvider` property if defined, otherwise
the URL will not work.

### Setup Email verification

To set the [email verification process](#email-verification-during-registration)
in your tenant the following must be done using an [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#update-a-tenant) to update your tenant records using `tenantAdmin` privileges:

*   Enable the registration page - set the `attributes.hide_register` parameter to `false`.
*   Use `signin_v_2` type - add the `attributes.signin_v_2` attribute containing the URL of the provider logo using `attributes.signin_v_2.logo_url` tenant parameter.
*   Enable `email_verification` feature flag (**NEW**) - set `attributes.feature_flags.email_verification` to `true`.

{% endif %}

## Fixed bugs

*   Fixed the error `Cannot add property token, object is not extensible` appears in the platform user interface when trying to evaluate JSONata expressions with `"$count()"`.

## Components


### Updates to multiple components

As a part of our on-going improvements of integration components, we

*   **UPDATED** Sailor version to `2.6.27`
*   **UPDATED** dependencies and addressed the packaged vulnerabilities
*   **ADDED** the component pusher job to `Circle.ci` configuration.

Here is the list of components for {{page.version}} release.
