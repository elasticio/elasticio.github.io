## Improvements and Updates

### Re-authentication for sensitive actions

While working on the platform user interface we try to click our way through
setup options and there is a chance we might accidentally remove a sensitive data.
There can be also cases when your account might be compromised and somebody would
deliberately try to cause harm.

For such cases we introduce re-authentication for sensitive actions. After
{{page.version}} for the following actions you will be asked to enter your password
to authenticate:

*   Reading, copying and regenerating your API Keys.
*   Modifying your user details.
*   Disabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).
*   Modifying, adding and removing members from contract or workspaces.

> **Please Note** You will be asked to re-authenticate once every 6 hours.

### Email verification during registration

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Separate MongoDB for Maester

When your integration flow needs to transfer big objects or attachments, one of
the platform microservices called Maester temporary stores them in MongoDB while
passing only the object IDs through the integration flow steps.

Starting from {{page.version}}, you can use a dedicated database for storing Maester
objects and the run-time attachments. To configure, add `MAESTER_MONGO_URI`
environment variable to HELM3 secrets charts and set it to target this new database.

> Note: You will need to migrate the grids to new MongoDB as well to ensure the Maester
> object availability after implementation.

If you don't need to use a separate MongoDB to store Maester object set
the `MAESTER_MONGO_URI` variable the same value as the `MONGO_URI` variable. This
will save objects in your main database.
