## Improvements and Updates

### Step designer: Movable divider

The {{page.version}} platform release introduces further improvement to the step
designer. Now you can move or drag the horizontal divider between the step designer
and the general flow structure. This way you can adjust your working area according
to your preference.

### Duplicate sign-in email

When the platform detects [duplicate sign-in session](/releases/22/06.html#improvements-and-updates)
for your account it sends an email notifying about it. In this release we improved
the text of this email for more clarity.

## Fixed bugs

*   Fixed the quota calculation mechanism on the UI to render more accurate values based on daily usage.
