## OEM Feature

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### White-labeled recipe management

In this release we introduce the recipe management feature for creating and
deploying the integration solutions in scale. You can now embed the entire
solution in your platform, App or website. No need for your clients to leave your
system and the solution can look as simple as an embedded form to active recipe.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2248/RN2248-embed-recipe-activation-form.png" title="Embed recipe activation form." %}

You can see an embedded form for recipe activation on a screenshot above. The following
instruction show how to create a similar page for your case.

> Please Note: You must have `tenantAdmin` role to succeed.

### Initial setup

The whole idea of recipe activation form embedding is to make the process as easy
as possible for your user. You take over the entire process of user creation and
registration and manage it behind the scene. Your user gets one URL to a form
to fill-in the necessary fields and activate the integration solution.

Here are the steps:

1.  Create a user - (`taenantAdmin` [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/users/post_users)).
2.  Add the newly created user as a contract member - (`tenantAdmin` [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/contracts/post_contracts__contract_id__members)).
3.  Add the same user as a workspace member - (`tenantAdmin` [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/workspaces/post_workspaces__workspace_id__members)).
4.  Revise user to allow necessary access required to activate a recipe.
5.  Create a onetime token for the user - (`tenantAdmin` [API call]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/users/post_users__user_id__one_time_token)).
6.  [Generate the access URL](#generate-access-url) for your user.
7.  Create and host [embed page](#embed-page).
8.  Confirmation for successful activation.

### Generate access URL

The access URL to a form must have the following format:
`https://[platform_domain]/embedded-recipe?recipeId=[recipeId]&oneTimeToken=[oneTimeToken]&contractId=[contractId]`

*   `platform_domain` (required). Your platform domain.
*   `recipeId` (required). Recipe ID which you want the user to activate.
*   `oneTimeToken` (required). Onetime token you generated earlier (step 5) to authenticate your user in the platform.
*   `contractId` (optional). Contract ID in which the user will activate the recipe. If you omit this parameter then the platform will use the first available contract where user is registered.

### Embed page

You can create an embed page following the example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Embedded Credentials Demo</title>
  <style>html, body, iframe { height: 85%; width: 90%; margin: 0;}</style>
</head>
<body>
  <iframe src="https://[platform_domain]/embedded-recipe?recipeId=[recipeId]&oneTimeToken=[oneTimeToken]&contractId=[contractId]" />
</body>
</html>
```
Here we use the generated URL in `iframe`. You can shape and style your page
according to your needs.

### Successful activation

When a user successfully activates a recipe, the platform sends a message with
a Recipe Deployment ID to the parent window.

```json
{
    "action": "eio:embedded-recipe:activate-success",
    "data": {
        "recipeDeploymentId": "RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT_ID"
    }
}
```
## Recipe deployment API

To manage recipes in scale and enable easy management we introduced
the [recipe deployment]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipe%20deployments)
new endpoints to our API. Along with this change, we updated related API endpoints
for consistency.

### Recipe deployment permissions

To manage recipe deployments for each tenant, we introduced `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.GET`,
`GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.SYNC` and `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.DELETE` permissions.

> Please Note: The `PATCH` and `DELETE` calls to edit or delete the flows will now
> return `403` Forbidden when the flow is part of a recipe deployment. You must first
> sever the connection between them. Check the
> [`GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.DELETE`](#globalrecipe_deploymentdelete) section to learn how.

#### `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.GET`

This permission allows to get recipe deployments. By default the `tenantAdmin`
role has this permission. It allows to get recipe deployments with `TENANT` scope
in the tenant.

With this permission you can use `?include=recipe-deployments` parameter to `GET`
`/v2/recipes`. The answer will include the connected `RecipeDeployment` in a response.

The standard user can fetch only recipe deployments:

*   Which are deployed into the workspace where he is a member,
*   All inside his tenant if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.GET` permission in the `TENANT` scope,
*   All inside the installation if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.GET` permission in the `GLOBAL` scope.

#### `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.SYNC`

This permission allows to stop the flows connected to a certain recipe, update it
to the latest version of the recipe and start it again. By default the `tenantAdmin`
role has this permission.

With this permission you can make `POST` HTTP request to `/v2/recipe-deployments/:id/sync`
to stop the flow, update and restart it.

The standard user can sync recipe deployments:

*   When recipe deployment belong to the workspace where he is a member (if he has a flow edit permission),
*   All inside his tenant if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.SYNC` permission in the `TENANT` scope,
*   All inside the installation if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.SYNC` permission in the `GLOBAL` scope.

#### `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.DELETE`

This permission allows to delete the recipe deployment but not the flows created
from it. It effectively cuts the connection between recipe deployment and the flow.

With this permission you can make an HTTP `DELETE` call to the `/v2/recipe-deployments/:id`
endpoint to delete the recipe deployment only.

The standard user can delete the recipe deployment:

*   When recipe deployment belongs to the workspace where he is a member (if he has a flow edit permission),
*   All inside his tenant if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.DELETE` permission in the `TENANT` scope,
*   All inside the installation if he has `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.DELETE` permission in the `GLOBAL` scope.
