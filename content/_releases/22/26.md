## Improvements and Updates

### Node.js Sailor version `2.6.28`

We released a new version (`2.6.28`) of the Node.js Sailor library version. This
version includes an additional mechanism to handle errors from maester during the
lightweight message upload.

### Edit Snapshot button always present

Now it is possible to edit/set the snapshot for any step of any draft even if the
flow has not been published or executed.
