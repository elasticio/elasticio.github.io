## Improvements

### Credentials Page: Search by component name

In our quest to improve every aspect of our User Interface, we added a search functionality
to the Credentials page. When you navigate to Integrate - Credentials you can now
use the Search by component name to find the credential card you need instead of
scrolling the page to find it.

### WebHook Step: Send sample request

When you configure WebHook component step in your integration flow, you can either
**Send sample request** or **Add sample manually**. When you select to send sample
request a WebHook address is provided which you can use to send your example sample.

We changed the wording to highlight that this address to be used **only one-time** to
send a representative sample which you can use to configure subsequent steps in your
integration flow.

### REST-API-V2 component POST and PUT body type

While configuring the REST-API-v2 component step in integration flows to `POST` or
`PUT` JSON body, we use `application/json` content type but forget to change the
input field from [Integrator to JSONata mode](/guides/mapping-data#jsonata-mode).
When the configuration is saved, the HTTP call body is saved with an incorrect
format resulting in unexpected or erroneous outcome during the flow execution.

To improve the user experience and prevent an accidental JSON data structure pasting
into the Body field while in an Integrator mode, we changed the User Interface
behaviour to default into JSONata mode when an `application/json` content type is
selected for the `POST` and `PUT` HTTP calls.

### Run-time environment variables

During the integration step execution, components exchange information with the
platform services and database entities using already defined run-time environment
variables. We are constantly working to standardise and add new environment variables
to streamline the information exchange. The following environment were added to
the run-time:

*   `WEBHOOK_URI` - This environment variable will be available to each step in the flow which exchanges the data with the webhook service of the platform, eg. [WebHook](/components/webhook/) or [Flow-linking](/components/flow-linking/). This environment variable from the Tenant attributes `webhooks_domain` or from the HELM3 environment variable `WEBHOOKS_BASE_URI` if the Tenant record is missing.

*   `ELASTICIO_CONTRACT_ID` - This environment variable will be available during the run-time of every execution including:
    *   Verify credentials
    *   Select model
    *   Dynamic metadata
    *   Generated samples and flow execution


## Updates

### Sailor-Nodejs `2.7.0`

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

Make iron-bank scalable: Move iron-bank into DaemonSet.
Now iron-bank runs together with cadvisor in the same pod in DaemonSet to reduce the load.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

 Webhook uri on the Frontend should be generated from the helm envar "WEBHOOKS_BASE_URI" in case if the corresponding variable is missing in the tenant
