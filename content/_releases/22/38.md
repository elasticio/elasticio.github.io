## Improvements

### Credentials Page: Search by component name

In our quest to improve every aspect of our User Interface, we added a search function
to the Credentials page. When you navigate to Integrate - Credentials you can now
Search by component name to find the credential card you need instead of scrolling
to find it.

### WebHook Step: Send sample request

When you configure a webhook component step in your integration flow, you can either
**Send sample request** or **Add sample manually**. When you select Send sample
request a WebHook address is provided which you can use to send your example sample.

We also highlight that this address to be used **only one-time** to
send a representative sample which you can use to configure subsequent steps in your
integration flow.

### REST-API-V2 component POST and PUT body type

To improve the user experience and prevent an accidental JSON data structure pasting
into the Body field while in an Integrator mode, we changed the User Interface
behaviour to default into JSONata mode when an `application/json` content type is
selected for the `POST` and `PUT` HTTP calls.

This change avoids possible errors when users forget to change the input field
settings deom [Integrator to JSONata mode](/guides/mapping-data#jsonata-mode).

### Run-time environment variables

Components exchange information with various platform services using run-time
environment variables during execution of each step of an integration flow.

We are constantly working to standardise and add new environment variables
to streamline the information exchange. The following environment variables were
added to the run-time:

*   `WEBHOOK_URI` - This environment variable will be available to each step in the flow which exchanges data with the webhook service, eg. [WebHook](/components/webhook/) or [Flow-linking](/components/flow-linking/). This environment variable from the Tenant attributes `webhooks_domain` or from the HELM3 environment variable `WEBHOOKS_BASE_URI` if the Tenant record is missing.

*   `ELASTICIO_CONTRACT_ID` - To help with troubleshooting of errors in multi-contract cases this environment variable will be available during the run-time of every execution including:
    *   Verify credentials
    *   Select model
    *   Dynamic metadata
    *   Generated samples and flow execution

## Updates

### Node.js Sailor version `2.7.0`

A new version of Node.JS Sailor library `2.7.0` is released. This update is
preparatory groundwork for the message persistence feature.

### Java Sailor version `3.4.0`

A new version of Java Sailor library `3.4.0` is released. This update is
preparatory groundwork for the message persistence feature.

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

### Iron-bank service Scalability

`Iron-bank` service collects statistics from the running integration flows. The
service is now running as Kubernetes DeamonSet together with
the `cadvisor`. This reduces the load on the system significantly and increases
the scalability of Iron Bank.

## Externally Build Docker Components

Information in this section is intended for our customers who intend to extend
the automatic component delivery to include custom developed components.


### API changes

Added new endpoint to `PATCH` `/v2/teams` to add docker registry to a team. Check
the [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2/#update-a-team) for the details.

### Components Pusher changes

#### HELM3 configuration changes

To extend the automatic component delivery to include custom developed components, we
modified the `componentsConfiguration` section of HELM3 charts in the following way:

```yaml
componentsConfiguration:
  developmentTeam: teamName
  components:
    componentName:
      # Image tag for pulling into the internal docker registry. Required, can be "latest"
      targetTag: latest
      # Image name by which to pull repo from registry. Optional, `team_name/repo_name` by default
      dockerRepoName: "orgName/repoName"
      # Team where create RepoBuild. Optional. Will override root `developmentTeam` on the `components` level
      developmentTeam: teamName
      # Access for the component in the platform context. Optional, `global` by default
      access: team
```

> Please Note: These are breaking changes and you should carefully revise your setup if you intend to use this feature.

*   `developmentTeam` - unchanged
*   `componentName` - unchanged
*   `registry`, `url`, `repo` and `tag` got changed into `dockerRepoName`, `developmentTeam`, `targetTag` and `access`. Please review these changes carefully.

Along with these changes the following new required variables were introduced:

*   `DOCKER_REGISTRIES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` used to encrypt credentials for docker registries
*   `COMPONENTS_PUSHER_AUTH_USERNAME` used to authenticate to components-pusher server
*   `COMPONENTS_PUSHER_AUTH_PASSWORD` used to authenticate to components-pusher server

The components-pusher expects to find these variables to deploy the component docker
images into your default team.

The new approach expects to also find a new optional `TEAM_DOCKER_REGISTRY` environment
variable in case of custom developed components. It is defined in the following way:

```yaml
TEAM_DOCKER_REGISTRY:
   uri: "https://index.docker.io/v1/"
   credentials:
       username: ""
       password: ""
```
For the `uri` system expects `string` containg the address of docker registry.
The `credentials` object can have the following properties:
*   `authFile` - path of the authentication file
*   `registryToken` - bearer token for accessing the source registry
*   `username` and `password`

If none of the above are used - `components-pusher` will try to access the registry
anonymously.

#### Behavior Changes

The `components-pusher` is not longer a cronjob but a fully integrated service of
the platform. It runs in Kubernetes cluster in a single instance (replicas non-configurable).

The service runs following way:

1.  Regularly checks for new builds for repositories with `dockerTargetTag` fields in the `repo` documents.
2.  When new builds of repository are detected they are copied into internal docker registry.
2.  The frequency of checks is configurable with the `.Values.componentsPusher.processLoopInterval` parameter of the `component-pusher` service. The frequency of checks is set in millisecond(ms). The default is 86400000 ms (1 day).
3.  The `component-pusher` uses the newly added internal endpoint (`/copy/:component_id?version=:version`) to pull of the specified component and version from docker registry. Uses basic authentication with `COMPONENTS_PUSHER_AUTH_USERNAME` and `COMPONENTS_PUSHER_AUTH_PASSWORD` values defined in the HELM3 charts.


### Gendry changes

*   `createTeam` task now creates/updates default team with docker registry data from the `TEAM_DOCKER_REGISTRY` environment variable
*   New `createDefaultRepos` task creates/updates components listed in `componentsConfiguration`. Teams, in which these repositories are created, require to have docker registry data associated with them. If default team used - docker registry data will be taken from `TEAM_DOCKER_REGISTRY` variable. If any other team used - it needs to be patched with correct docker registry data using API endpoint `PATCH` `/v2/teams`.

## Fixed bugs

*   Fixed the User Interface bug where the execution logs could not be copied.
*   Fixed unexpected behavior of the Time Picker when filtering in the Threads and Execution pages.
*   Addressed the limitation when credentials fields (`oauth` and additional fields, `baseUrl`, etc ) could not be retrieved in the `OAuthFieldView`. Now all fields can be accessed directly from the `cfg` object.
