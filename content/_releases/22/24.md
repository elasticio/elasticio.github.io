## Improvements and Updates

### Change of Footer position

Previously, the footer which renders the Version, Privacy Policy and ToS was located below the step slide. At times, this could be inconvenient during flow design. That is why we decided to move the footer to the left, to the very bottom of the dashboard.

### Re-authentication for sensitive actions (final part)

This is part 3 of our initiative to prevent accidental or malicious changes to
sensitive data and follows on from releases
[22.20](/releases/22/20#re-authentication-for-sensitive-actions) and [22.22](/releases/22/22#re-authentication-for-sensitive-actions-continuation).

This time we extend the list of actions for which you will be asked to enter your
password to authenticate:

* Support authentication in cases OIDC/SAML is used to login

> **Again, please note**: You will be asked to re-authenticate once every 6 hours.

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Component-build-helper

We are introducing a new function an cli command -  `generateDockerfile`. Here is how to use it:

*   Returns dockerfile string for component.
> **Please Note:** Supports only nodejs components for now.

  * Add sailor version and component type (nodejs, java) docker labels
  * If Dockerfile is already present, don't generate it, return existing.
  * Move build artifact from build layer to minimize the size of the result image.

GenerateDockerfile cli command usage example:

```
from folder:
   component_cli generateDockerfile /path/to/component/folder
from stdin:
   git archive master | component_cli generateDockerfile -
```

Another new functionality we wan to introduce will calculate the `nodejs` version
for component using from engine field (from package.json). Here is how to use it:

*   Detect nodejs version from package.json (engine.range field) or use latest lts one.
*   Use [http://nodejs.org/dist/](http://nodejs.org/dist/) uri to get `nodejs` version list.
*   Use it in a base image tag together with -alpine (to use latest alpine OS), repo: https://hub.docker.com/_/node.

> **Please Note:** Do not support of overriding npm version via package.json.

#### Gitreceiver

Here are some important notice how to use Gitreceiver:

*   use `generateDockerfile` function to get dockerfile
*   do not run `appbuilder` for `nodejs` components
*   use sailor version and component language, calculated by component-build-helper lib

#### Component development

Custom dockerfile supported for the `nodejs` components. In case component developer
created Dockerfile in the root of component directory, it will be used in the gitreceiver during deploy.

>**Please Note:** custom dockerfile is not supported for Java component yet.
NodeJS 18 is supported now.
