## Features

## Genetare One-Time-Token permission

We have changed the name of permission `tenants.tenant.edit_roles` to `global.tenant.edit_roles`. Now `PATCH /v2/tenants/:tenantId/roles` allows to create a new role with permissions in a tenant scope. We have also updatet API endpoint `PATCH /v2/tenants/{tenant_id}/members/{user_id}` which allows to grant any role from tenants scope to any tenant user. This will allow to give any user `tenants.user.generate_one_time_token` permission.


## New recipe visibility

We are introducing a new permission `GLOBAL.RECIPE.GET` to view **all** recipes based on permissions's scope and gave the new permission to `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` with Global level. This is the first step in the development of a new feature, in which the new role of the superuser will allow you to review and approve recipes, as well as increase their level up to tenant if necessary.
