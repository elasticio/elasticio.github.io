## Improvements and Updates

### Step designer: Credentials part

We have improved the credentials part to provide more unified user experience
during the flow design. The look and feel is now more in line with our new user
interface approach.

In this new view we moved the **Verify**, **Edit** and **Delete** functions for
each credential to a contextual menu which you can open by selecting three dots in the end
of each credential record.

### Node.js Sailor version `2.6.29`

A new version of the Node.JS Sailor library `2.6.29` is released. For Users who
develop their own components using our SDKs this update enables keep-alive functionality
for the `https` outgoing connections as well. This functionality reduces the number
of `https` reconnects in favour of using already open connections.


### Component build helper `1.1.0`

A new version of the `component-build-helper` library `1.1.0` is released. This
library is used by the platform to build components when a new version of an
integration component is deployed. For more information check the
[component build configuration requirements](/developers/component-build-configuration)
document for supported Java versions and limitations.
