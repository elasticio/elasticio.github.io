## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Support new component builder for java components

We are introducing a new `сomponent-build-helper` [version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic.io/component-build-helper) `0.1.0`. It also means that the old appbuilder is totally deprecated and is no longer supported. We have added custom dockerfile support for Java components.

> **Please Note:** For now our new component builder supports Java 8 based components only.
