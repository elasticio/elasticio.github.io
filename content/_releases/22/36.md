## Improvements and Updates

### Credentials: New design & improved responsiveness

We continue to update our User Interface to improve ease of use and reduce UI lag. This time it is the UI surrounding Credentials that is updated. When you navigate to Integrate > Credentials you will notice larger icons and a more coherent design.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credentials-page.png" title="Credentials Page" %}

When you select a component from the Component Overview page, you will see the redesigned Component Credential view. The Salesforce component is shown here as an example:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential.png" title="Component Credential" %}

In this view you can select the kebab menu (3 vertical dots) at the right of each credential to **Verify**, **Edit**, or **Delete** the Credentials. Alternatively, you can select the `+` icon to the right of the search field if you want to create a new Credential.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential-mod.png" title="Credential Modification" %}

Here is how each credential page looks when you Edit it:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/EN2236-credential-edit.png" title="Edit the Credential" %}

### Retrieve new sample button

While developing new integration flows it is often necessary to retrieve new sample data after each flow step is created. This was previously possible by navigating **Back**. In this release we have added a new button **Retrieve new sample from component** that allows you to create new sample data without navigating away from your work.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-retrieve-new-sample-button.png" title="Retrieve new sample button" %}

### Long lines in Code component

We improved the user interface of the Node.js Code component configuration field.
Now you can use long lines of code witout spaces and the interface will wrap it for you.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-code-wrap.png" title="Code wrapping." %}


{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Registration page improvement

If your tenant is using the registration page and the `email_verification` parameter
is enabled (set to `true`) then only the email address field will be displayed.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step1.png" title="Registration Page: Step 1 - Enter your email address." %}

When an User enters their E-mail address and presses **Register**, an Email verification link is sent to the mail address. Through this link Users can then enter their password:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step2.png" title="Registration Page: Step 2 - Enter the password." %}

{% endif %}

## Fixed bugs

* We have made our platform more robust by ensuring that User metadata which defines views of each workspace is backed up and recreated even if the data has been deleted from its primary location (RabbitMQ).
