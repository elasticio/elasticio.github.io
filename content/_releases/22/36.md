## Improvements and Updates

### Credentials page: new design

This is continuation of our effort to modernise and harmonise the look and feel of the
platform user interface. In this release we have improved the Credentials page. When
you navigate to Integrate > Credentials page you will see a similar view:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credentials-page.png" title="Credentials Page" %}

When you select a component from the Component Overview page, you will see the redesigned Component Credential view. The Salesforce component is shown here as an example:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential.png" title="Component Credential" %}

In this view you can select the kebab menu (3 vertical dots) at the right of each credential to **Verify**, **Edit**, or **Delete** the Credentials. Alternatively, you can select the `+` icon to the right of the search field if you want to create a new Credential.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential-mod.png" title="Credential Modification" %}

Here is how each credential page looks when you Edit it:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/EN2236-credential-edit.png" title="Edit the Credential" %}

### Retrieve new sample button

While developing new integration flows it is often necessary to retrieve new sample data after each flow step is created. This was previously possible by navigating **Back**. In this release we have added a new button **Retrieve new sample from component** that allows you to create new sample data without navigating away from your work.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-retrieve-new-sample-button.png" title="Retrieve new sample button" %}

### Long lines in Code component

We improved the user interface of the Node.js Code component configuration field.
Now you can use long lines of code witout spaces and the interface will wrap it for you.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-code-wrap.png" title="Code wrapping." %}


{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Registration page improvement

If your tenant is using the registration page and the `email_verification` parameter
is enabled (set to `true`) then only the email address field will be displayed.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step1.png" title="Registration Page: Step 1 - Enter your email address." %}

When you enter your email address and press **Register** then an email is sent to
your address with a special link to follow to verify your email address. When you
follow the link you are presented with the second step to enter a password:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step2.png" title="Registration Page: Step 2 - Enter the password." %}

{% endif %}
