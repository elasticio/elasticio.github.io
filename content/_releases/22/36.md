## Improvements and Updates

### Credentials page: new design

This is continuation of our effort to modernise and harmonise look and feel of the
platform user interface. In this release we improved the Credentials page. When
you navigate to Integrate > Credentials page you will see a similar view:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credentials-page.png" title="Credentials Page" %}

When you select a component your screen would look like the one below for Salesforce:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential.png" title="Component Credential" %}

You can select 3 dots to open the menu to **Verify**, **Edit** or **Delete** the credentials
or use **+** (plus) in the right above to create a new one.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-credential-mod.png" title="Credential Modification" %}

Here is how each credential page looks when you Edit it:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/EN2236-credential-edit.png" title="Edit the Credential" %}

### Retrieve new sample button

While designing the flow using the flow designer often we need to retrieve new
sample for the step after making modifications. To improve the user experience
we added a new button **Retrieve new sample from component**.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-retrieve-new-sample-button.png" title="Retrieve new sample button" %}

You can now click to retrieve new sample instead of navigating **Back** to do this.

### Long lines in Code component

We improved the user interface of the Node.js Code component configuration field.
Now you can use long lines of code witout spaces and the interface will wrapp it for you.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-code-wrap.png" title="Code wrapping." %}


{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.



## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Registration page improvement

If your tenant is using the registration page and the `email_verification` parameter
is enabled (set to `true`) then only the email address field will show at first.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step1.png" title="Registration Page: Step 1 - Enter your email address." %}

When you enter your email address and press **Register** then an email is sent to
your address with a special link to follow to verify your email address. When you
follow the link you are presented with the second step to enter a password:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2236/RN2236-registration-step2.png" title="Registration Page: Step 2 - Enter the password." %}

{% endif %}
