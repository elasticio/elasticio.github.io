## Improvements and Updates

Render an error message when trying to add an invalid SSH key.

Before, if a user tries to add a malformed or un-supported SSH key, the UI does not render an informative error. Instead, the Save button is simply disabled without any justification.
Now, a text error message appears with an explanation of the problem.

Update "commons" and "api" to support components pull from external docker registries.
add new attribute docker_registry object into POST /v2/teams/
attributes.docker_registry.uri - Docker Registry URI
attributes.docker_registry.credentials - Docker Registry credentials

add new attributes docker_repo_name and docker_target_tag into POST /v2/components (can be set if its team has docker_registry object)
attributes.docker_repo_name - String representing component's name in docker registry. Available only if team supports docker registry
attributes.docker_target_tag - String representing component's tag in docker registry. Available only if team supports docker registry

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

Add support for Kubernetes 1.22.
Now our platform is compatible with Kubernetes 1.22 given the API changes.

Implement MongoDB TLS verification in all services.
New helm config is introduced:

.Values.global.secrets.mongodbTlsCertificateKey - secret name with tls certificate and key. If specified, will be mounted to the services and specified in the tlsCertificateKeyFile connection option. See docs.
.Values.global.secrets.mongodbTlsCA - secret name with CA certificate to validate mongodb server certificate in the client side. If specified, will be mounted to the services and specified in the tlsCAFile connection option. See docs.



## OEM Related

Information in this section is intended for our customers who use the
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

TTL for TaskStats.
TaskStats are what we show on Dashboard and Runlog. And currently fresh installations store them infinitely. We set retention to 5 days by default, controlled by env var.

Breaking changes:
Introduced new env var TASK_STAT_START_INDEX_TTL , default is 432000 (5 days), changing value after 1st deployment will not apply anymore (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/reference/command/createIndexes/#index-options).
If customer want to change default value - it's need to be performed before deploy this release.

If you want to change it in future, you should remove expireAfterSeconds option from start index from DB and after set new value for env var TASK_STAT_START_INDEX_TTL
