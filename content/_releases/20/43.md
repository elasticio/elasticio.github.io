## Features

### Secrets Feature

We are happy to announce the public release of Secrets feature - a service which independently
keeps access tokens up-to-date so any integration step would get a valid and working
access credentials to the third party resources. The service updates tokens behind the
scene using the token expiration information.

Secrets addresses the race-condition and other contention-on-shared-data problems
of OAuth2 authorisation process frequently happening due to concurrent and asynchronous
work of steps in different integration flows. With this service in place, components
are not required to update the access tokens. The Secrets takes over this process
and supplies the Components up-to-date access tokens directly.

For more details visit the dedicated [Secrets feature](/getting-started/secrets)
documentation page.

### New components working with Secrets

Along with the public release of Secrets we are releasing two new generation
components, **REST API v2** and **Salesforce v2**, which use the Secrets Management Service.

These fully refurbished components are not strictly backwards compatible due to
architectural differences between Secrets and the ordinary Credentials systems.

The old versions of these components are still available for a foreseeable future,
however, they will be marked as deprecated. We will only make security updates if
required, but further development of these versions will not be done.

**We encourage our customers to try the new generation components and give us your feedback.**

### Visibility Authentication Clients

With this release we completed the authentication clients (`auth-client`)
visibility levels. The `auth-client` can now have `workspace`, `contract`, `tenant`
and `global` access levels. This means you can create `auth-client` for any access
level, be that only for one workspace or for the entire cluster of tenants.

Check our [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/auth%20clients/post_auth_clients)
for more information on `auth-client` creation.

## Improvements and Updates

### Execution and Logs pages

From this release, all execution threads on Executions page will show the times
in absolute format AM/PM or 24h depending on your local setup.

We are introducing **Clear all filters** enhancement for Executions and Logs pages
for clearing all selected filters in one go. Here is an example of usage on Logs
page:

> This feature is hidden by CSS by default so that the look & feel of OEM tenants
> is not disrupted. Feel free to adjust the CSS to introduce this functionality in your tenant.

### Mapper UI

We continue our efforts to streamline and improve the new mapping experience
based on your feedback. In this release we concentrated on loading time
improvements, JSONata previews, dynamic drop-downs and manual sample creation.

When using JSONata expression for input fields, the preview is rendered with
"pretty print" instead of one single line of code which ehances the mapping
experience and helps to spot any errors while building an integration flows.

When using the dynamic drop-downs fields the search appears only if there are
more than 7 items to choose. In addition, all dynamic drop-downs have reload buttons
to refresh the list.

While designing an integration flow you can just use an automatic sample regenerated
the platform and already populated based on the metadata.

### Authentication Secrets with Agents

Now you can choose to add Authentication credentials for the steps running on
Local Agents. It works for old and new VPN Agents.
