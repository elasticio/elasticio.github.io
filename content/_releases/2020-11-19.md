## Features

### Debug and one-time execution logs

We introduce a new possibility to obtain the debug and one-time executions logs
straight from the logs window. You can choose to **Download** the logs directly to your
computer and the system will give you a time-stamped `*.log` file or you can choose
**Copy to clipboard** to paste the logs where you need. The small animation below shows
these options.

## Improvements and Updates

With this release we spent considerable time to streamline and improve the platform
UI pages. For example **the executions page is now more responsive and the new executions show much faster than before**.
By our initial estimate it loads 20 to 30% faster. Further investigation and
improvements to come.

The mapper UI received a particular attention where we improved the
usability of multiple features explained in the following subsections.

### Empty dynamic-select model

While using the dynamically selectable fields from third party sources you might
encounter situations when no metadata is returned. In this cases we will show the
following warning text to text:

> Unfortunately the service behind the component did not provide any options for the given credentials. This is not necessarily an error. Please check whether there are data for the given credential and retrieve the options again by clicking on the Reload icon on the right side of the drop-down element.

### Re-sizable text-input fields

All text-input fields now grow with the content. When the you have an input longer than
4 to 5 lines, a new vertical resize selector in the right bottom corner of the
field appears. You can use it to extend the field for your viewing convenience.

### Scrolling of mapped fields

You can scroll to see all the content of mapped fields in any saved flow versions.
The scroll-bars show not only the input fields but besides the mapping results too.
