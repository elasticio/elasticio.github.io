## Features

### Debug and one-time execution logs

We introduce a new possibility to obtain the debug and one-time executions logs
straight from the logs window. You can choose to **Download** the logs directly to your
computer and the system will give you a time-stamped `*.log` file or you can choose
**Copy to clipboard** to paste the logs where you need. The small animation below shows
these options.

## Improvements and Updates

With this release we spent considerable time to streamline and improve the platform
UI pages. For example **the executions page is now more responsive and the new executions show much faster than before**.
By our initial estimate it loads 20 to 30% faster. We also load next and previous
executions pages asynchronously to improve the first page loading speed.

The mapper UI received a particular attention where we improved the
usability of multiple features explained in the following subsections.

### Empty dynamic-select model

While using the dynamically selectable fields from third party sources you might
encounter situations when no metadata is returned. In this cases we will show the
following warning text to text:

> Unfortunately the service behind the component did not provide any options for the given credentials. This is not necessarily an error. Please check whether there are data for the given credential and retrieve the options again by clicking on the Reload icon on the right side of the drop-down element.

### Re-sizable text-input fields

All text-input fields now grow with the content. When the you have an input longer than
4 to 5 lines, a new vertical resize selector in the right bottom corner of the
field appears. You can use it to extend the field for your viewing convenience.

### Scrolling of mapped fields

You can scroll to see all the content of mapped fields in any saved flow versions.
The scroll-bars show not only the input fields but besides the mapping results too.

### Object types in mapping fields

You can now switch between Integrator and Developer modes and edit without a problem
while using any `object` type in your mapping.

### Node.js and Java Sailor updates

We are constantly improving Sailor versions for Node.js and Java programming
languages. In this round we addressed edge cases when trigger and action functions
might output sensitive data while processing error stacks. Here are the most recent
versions:

*  Node.js Sailor version `2.6.18`
*  Java Sailor version `3.3.1`

### Auth-clients without expiration

To address certain 3rd party OAuth2 provider unique setups we introduced default
`token_expires_in` parameter with 1 hour interval. The background of the problem
came from the cases when the external systems (e.g. Salesforce) would not return
`token_expires_in` for the `auth-client` calls.

Now any authentication client without `expieres_in` parameter receives a default
`token_expires_in` parameter with 1 hour value. This value will propagate to the
connected secrets as well. The API documentation was updated accordingly.

### Configure timeouts for debug tasks

You can now configure how long it would take the one-time or debug tasks to timeout
and severe the connection with the third party resource. We introduced a new variable
`FORCE_DESTROY_DEBUG_TASK_TIMEOUT_SEC` which can be defined in platform deployment
`config.json` file to control this behaviour. If this parameter is not defined the
default behaviour is the following:

*   Frontend timeout after 60 seconds.
*   Admiral timeout in 180 seconds.

### Removing default favicon for tenants

If the favicon is not defined for your tenant the platform will return 404 on
`/favicon.ico` address. Please make sure to define it as a tenant parameter for your
tenant. Contact support if you require assistance.

### Recipes permissions per tenant

Now you can enable or disable which role holder can create recipes from the flows.
When disabling users will not see create recipe button in the menu. For more technical
details contact our support.

## Fixed Bugs

*   **Fixed the bug when the mapped data would disappear after component version change.**
*   Addresses issue when a JSONata expression would disappear from the mapped fields.
*   Fixed the issue when the system would not save dynamic-select model in cache.
*   Fixed the problem when select-model stops executing while opening the log window in the flow-designer.
*   Addressed the behaviour when data from previous steps would disappear after some manipulations.
*   Fixed the inconsistency when duplicate logs were shown during the flow-designer.
*   Addressed the "Allowed Values" limitation of the new mapping experience to handle large number of values.
*   Fixed the bug in case of REST API component when the user entries would disappear.
*   Addressed the problem when the metadata would disappear in case of identical value entry in the drop-down list (select model).
*   Fixed a strange behaviour in the new mapping experience with changed select-model lists.
*   Addressed the problem with Splitter component when component would constantly "blink" between configured and non-configured modes during flow design.
*   Fixed the problem when the Browser window would crash during editing a flow with large number of steps.
