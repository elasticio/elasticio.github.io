As you may have noticed from the latest releases, we are working on the design improvements. Now our team is working on new view for the step configuration panel. We will announce your more information in the next releases.

We are also working on API documentation improvements.

## Improvements and Updates

### Store Flows page selected layout information

Previously, when you chose a convenient flows page view - *Grid* or *List* - the choice was not saved.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2151/rn2151-view-types.png" title="View types" %}

Now we save information about your choice in your browser and the view that is convenient for you will remain even after you log out of your account.

## Fixed Bugs

*  Now after deleting the contract, workspace and flow are released from quota usage
*  Fix URL in the invitation letter to developer team.
*  Fix problem with configuration SAML providers for custom login and logout redirect. For details please see this [article](/releases/21.47#custom-login-and-logout-redirects).
