## Features

## Improvements and Updates

### Copy flow

### Custom Error Management

After initial feedback from you, we changed our Custom Error Management icon to
**info** icon and move the button to the top-right side of the flow designer.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixes performance issue with the flow designer when inspecting any step would trigger draft save and unnecessary calls to API data sample endpoint.
*   Addresses the problem of horizontal scrolling of the flow designer view on small screens with left-hand side menu open. Now the flow designer header icons and items get minimised to fit into smaller screens.
*   Fixes the UI problem with the credentials pages when every edit would create duplicate credential record.
*   Addresses the problem when error message would not disappear after choosing credential in the copied flow.
