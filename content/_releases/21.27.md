## Features



## Improvements and Updates


### Executions page slow loading

With the {{page.version}} release we improved the loading speeds of the execution
threads. In this scope the following improvements were done:

*   Optimised the internal communications between the UI and back-end services.
*   The revised and improved the threads list (execution page) and individual threads pages.
*   The default time intervals for listing the threads is now 7 days instead of previous 30 days.

We also added a new environment variable to the system (`BRAN_RETENTION_MONTHS_MESSAGES`)
This variable defines the number of months to store the data for Executions page.
The default value is `1` (1 month).

## HELM3

We are in middle of constantly improving various aspects of HELM3 deployments in
collaborations with our partners. These are updates and improvements done in
this round.

### Kubernetes Namespaces

With {{page.version}} release we remove Kubernetes namespace hard-coding from our
charts.

> **IMPORTANT** : Before you deploy this version you must add the following
> annotation to all existing Kubernetes namespaces:

```yaml
annotations:
    helm.sh/hook: pre-install
    helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation
    helm.sh/hook-weight: "0"
```

Edit namespaces through `kubectl` command before deployments. Failure to do so
would result in failure of {{page.version}} version deployment. To disable
automatic namespace creation you need to set `global.namespaces.enabled` to
`false` (default is `true`).

### Redis deployment is optional

To support external Redis service we made the service as optional and the HELM3
charts were changed accordingly. To use en external Redis service follow these
steps:

1.  Set the `values.global.services.maesterRedis.enabled` and `values.global.services.cache.enabled` values as `false`. This means both Redis services will not be deployed during the deployment.
2.  Add values for the following parameters to use external Redis:
    *   `values.global.config.CACHE_REDIS_URI`: `redis://uri-to-external.redis`,
    *   and `values.global.config.MAESTER_REDIS_URI` : `redis://uri-to-external.redis`.


### Charts Security Audit

An audit of HELM3 charts were performed to remove any sensitive data like keys, password
and credentials from main charts. All sensitive data were migrated into the secrets.

News in this section are for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Control Number of Contract Users

You can now control number of users in any contract in your tenant. This new
feature works through the platform quota service and has a unique API endpoint
`/v2/quotas/per_contract_user_count_limit`.

> Note: The default value of this quota is `-1`, which means unlimited.

As with all types of quotas you need `global.quota_limits.edit` permission to
apply any values.

When the quota is set for a contract the following rules apply:

*   You can not invite a new member to your contract when quota is exhausted. The invitation will not be created.
*   You can not add a user via an API call when the quota is exhausted.
*   You can not redeem previously sent invitation to the contract when the quota is exhausted in the meantime.
*   If the support user functionality is enabled in your tenant then adding support user to your workspace is not counted towards your contract quota.

### Quota Release and Apply Process

We extended the `/sidedoor/quotatxns/sync` endpoint used to sync the quotas during
the release process. This endpoint must be called once to sync the correct numbers
of users in contracts and workspaces with the `quotatxns` data base.

You can add an extra parameter that represents resource type to sync. Available
types are `user` and `workspace`. For example:

*   `/sidedoor/quotatxns/sync/user`,
*   `/sidedoor/quotatxns/sync/workspace`.

For this release you must call the following commands to properly sync:

`curl -u 'username@password'  -X POST API/sidedoor/quotatxns/sync/user`
`curl -u 'username@password'  -X POST API/sidedoor/quotatxns/sync/workspace`

You need to have `AccessManager.ACTIONS.GLOBAL.QUOTATXN.SYNC` permission to work
with these endpoints.
