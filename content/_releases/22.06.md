## Features

### Step configuration: new design

As we announced in the [22.04 release notes](/releases/22.04) we are introducing
new look and feel for the integration flow step designer.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2204/eio-step-slide-overview.png" title="New Step Designer" %}

The new step designer includes the following improvement and advancements to the
flow step configuration process:

*   You can view more than one section of the step configuration by opening the desired ones individually. You can expand and collaps all sections.
*   The new view shows more information about used component, like the version, used function and credential ID.
*   We enforce Continue buttons for configuration fields to make it clearer.
*   The passthrough on/off configuration now resides in the Advanced Settings of the Summary section.


## Improvements and Updates

The release {{page.version}} includes lot's of work under the hood. Our team is
working to improve and refactor some of the core microservices.

### Component deployments via Docker images

In our 22.02 release view announced our intention to find a new path for component
deployments. The one which would not require direct involvement of our support.

With this release we are happy to let you know that we have made significant progress
in identifying the reliable mechanism and testing our first node.js and Java component
deployments using the automated build processes from CircleCI.

Here is the workflow we have already in place:

1.  New version (`tag`) is created in the GitHub component repository and the release is published.
2.  CircleCI build process uses `appbuilder` + `apprunner` images.
3.  Docker image of the component is built with the `tag` version and submitted into the Dockerhub.
4.  An additional `latest` version is created at Dockerhub side each time code is updated.

Stay tuned for our next steps.

## OEM Related

News in this section are for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Quota for flow count

In the release [21.45 we announced](/releases/21.45) about the new quota feature capability to
limit flow counts per `workspace`, `contract` and `tenant`. To apply this quota
you must have either the **Service Account** or **Quota Manager** credentials.

*   If you host your own installation (on-premises case) then you already have these credentials.
*   If you have an OEM tenant on elastic.io hosted clusters talk to us for the quota management.

We have now a dedicated documentation page about the
[Flow Count Limit](https://on-prem.elastic.io/admin/quotas/flow-count-limit).
