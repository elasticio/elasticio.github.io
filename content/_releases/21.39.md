## Features

### Development section

With the platform release version {{page.version}} we introduce a separate
sub-section to the navigation menu to logically separate the component Development
from the rest. A new Development section includes the link to Developer Teams as
well as the try metadata tool (mentioned in the [21.37 release](/releases/21.37#try-metadata-tool)).

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2139/rn2139-development-menu.png" title="Development menu." %}

The development teams are no longer linked from the contract management screen.
Contract Members, Workspaces and the Quota Usages are still accessible via the
Contract Settings section.

## HELM3

We are in middle of constantly improving various aspects of HELM3 deployments in
collaborations with our partners. These are updates and improvements done in
this round.

### Certificate Manager

With platform version {{page.version}} we introduce a possibility to manage the SSL
certificate using the certificate manager of your choice. The following changes were
made in the `Handmaiden` platform microservice:

*   We introduce new optional environment variable called `CERT_MANAGER_ISSUER_NAME`.
*   If the `CERT_MANAGER_ISSUER_NAME` is specified, then will use the issuers for the ingresses, created by handmaiden tenant-operator. You do not need to create secrets in this case.
*   We also introduce the `CERT_MANAGER_ISSUER_KIND` variable. Default value: `issuer`. Use this value for the issuer annotation. If the `CERT_MANAGER_ISSUER_KIND` is equal `cluster-issuer`, use cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer annotation in the created ingresses.
*   Default tenant certificate is optional (not created if not provided).

For the HELM3 declare the configurations and bind it to the handmaiden environment
variables like:

```yaml
    handmaiden:
      issuer:
#        name: letsencrypt-issuer
#        # Available values: issuer/cluster-issuer
#        kind: issuer
```

{% endif %}

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixed the platform API service response incorrect code (`5xx`) while making an HTTP `POST` call to the `/v2/contracts/{CONTRACT_ID}/(un)suspend`. Now the API response with `204` if successful and `409` if the contract is already suspended.
