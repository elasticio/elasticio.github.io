## Features

### Development section

With the platform release version {{page.version}} we introduce a separate
sub-section to the navigation menu to logically separate the component Development
from the rest. A new Development section includes the link to Developer Teams as
well as the try medatadata tool (mentioned in the [21.37 release](/release/21.37#try-metadata-tool)).
