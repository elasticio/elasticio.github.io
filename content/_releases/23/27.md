## New Features
### Transfer modal windows to the new styles:

We transferred three sections of Flow Designer from Ember to React:
* Components section
* Versions
* Functions

### "Containers" Page: Renamed all columns related to the statuses to one name

To avoid any confusion for our users we have applied one name "Status" for all columns that related to the statuses of containers.
