## improvements

### Embedded Recipe Page: Recipe Credentials Edit

We introduce the ability to create embedded page for editing credentials for a single resipe's deployment.

New API endpoint:  `GET /v2/recipe-deployments/:recipe_deployment_id` (required same permissions and scopes as in `/v2/recipe/:recipe_id?include=recipe-deployments`). Please visit [API Docs](({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipe%20deployments)) for more details.

**Notion docs** (need to add to release notes) - https://www.notion.so/elasticio/Embedded-recipe-deployment-14933fc2918a4dba886ac70faf93f1b6

### Create/Edit Recipe API-Call

We are introdusing `POST /v2/flows/export-to-recipe` API Call. With this cola you can:

* export a set of flows to a recipe.
* update existing recipe with set of new flows.

This new, more powerful endpoint, replaces the old one - `POST /v2/flows/${flowId}/export-to-recipe`. Please visit [API Docs](({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipes/post_flows_export_to_recipe)) for more details.

### Flow Queues improvements

Before, the Flow Queues page displays the components inverted according to the flow graph (e.g if graph contain fork or content-based router) and don't display the step name, only the number.

Now we render step name on Flow Queues page (like on Flow Designer) and render flow graph at Flow Queues, Runlog Execution, Thread pages in the same way as at Flow Designer page.


## Fixed bugs

### [Failed to render flow-queue page after quick publishing flow-draft and start or old flow graph renders if flow has previous version](https://github.com/elasticio/elasticio/issues/6685).

*   **FIXED** bug, when the Credentials for components which uses secrets and **Recipe** page which uses secrets are failed to load. You will be shown a message inside the credential block stating that the user does not have permissions to view credentials and all credential fields are empty.
