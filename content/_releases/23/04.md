## Improvements

### Embedded Recipe Page: Recipe Credentials Edit

We previously introduced the ability to add new credentials for a deployed recipe via an embedded page in a 3rd-party site or app. Today we introduce the ability to create an embedded page for editing credentials for a single recipe deployment. For this purpose we have created a new API endpoint `GET /v2/recipe-deployments/:recipe_deployment_id`. This endpoint requires same permissions and scopes as in `/v2/recipe/:recipe_id?include=recipe-deployments`.

> Please visit [API Docs](({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipe%20deployments)) for more details on this API endpoint.

> For more informaition on Embedded recipe deployment please read this [article](/guides/embedded-recipe-deployment/).

### Create/Edit Recipe API-Call

We are introdusing `POST /v2/flows/export-to-recipe` API Call. With this call you can:

* export a set of flows to a recipe.
* update existing recipe with set of new flows.

This new, more powerful endpoint, replaces the old one - `POST /v2/flows/${flowId}/export-to-recipe`. Please visit [API Docs](({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipes/post_flows_export_to_recipe)) for more details.

### Flow Queues improvements

Before, the Flow Queues page displays the components inverted according to the flow graph (e.g if graph contain fork or content-based router) and don't display the step name, only the number.

Now we render step name on Flow Queues page (like on Flow Designer) and render flow graph at Flow Queues, Runlog Execution, Thread pages in the same way as at Flow Designer page.
