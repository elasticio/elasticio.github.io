## Features

### Configurable Recipe Use for Contracts

As a continuation of the updates introduced in Release [23.06](/releases/23/06#new-recipe-createedit-ui-features), we have added new features in recipe management. This feature allows Tenant Admins to control which users are allowed to create/edit Recipes (by default, all users can use the recipes feature). You can set it up with a new permission `tenants.contract.edit_feature_flags` - allow to set the feature flags for Contract.

In this regard, POST and PATCH v2/contracts endpoins were changed - added an ability to set the feature flags for Contract.

> **Please Note:** this permission belongs to tenant admins by default.

Here you can see an example of a request body:

```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "contract",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Contract name",
      "available_roles": [
        {
          "scope": "contracts",
          "role": "admin"
        }
      ],
      "flow_stats_enabled_default": true,
      "support_user_id": "5b4f337bff4304610483ba67",
      "custom_data": {
        "description": "Contract description"
      },
      "feature_flags": {
        "disable_recipe_feature": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Please Note:** "disable_recipe_feature" set to "false" be default.

### Extend the UI view class `RESTAPIView` with the `application/x-ndjson`

We transformed "Content type" dropdown on the "Body" tab of the REST API v2 component to a text field with a dropdown of a hints:

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2308/rn2308-rest-api-v2.png" title="Export Recipe" %}

- the hints appear when your cursor is over the field and list reacts when you enter characters into the text field.
- you can choose an item from the hints dropdown
- if no existing entries meet your needs, you can enter your custom content type and save it
- we validate Content-type header according to [list of all the official MIME types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

### Reducing the refresh time of auth-secrets

We now refresh auth-secret tokens closer to the token expiry. This change to 30 seconds before expiry (it used to be 60 seconds) is because various external APIs do not allow refreshes 1 minute before expiry (as example, [ExactOnline](https://support.exactonline.com/community/login?ec=301&startURL=%2Fcommunity%2Fs%2Fknowledge-base%23All-All-DNO-Simulation-gen-apilimits)) don't allow to refresh secret very early.

## Improvements

### Change the text of the buttons "Delete" to "Unlink"

We continue to work towards the recipes feature. In this release we have changed the text in context menu and modals for managing recipe's deployments in the next way:

- "Delete" to "Unlink"
- "Delete With Flows" to "Unlink and Delete Flows"

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaboration
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements included in this release.

### New HElM enviroment variable

We are introducing a new HELM enviroment variable `RECIPES_FEATURE_DISABLED` - it controls whether users are allowed to create/edit Recipes. Set to **"false"** by default.
