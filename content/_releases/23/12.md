## Features

### Pub-sub support

Recipes can now contain the declarations.topics property with a list of pub-sub topic declarations. Users can define topic id in the same way as for credentials in the flow template.
On activaton of a recipe which contains topic(s) - we create the required topic(s) in the corresponding workspace.

> You can find more information about this new feature on the [API documentation page]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipes)

### Transform UI for "Settings" page to React

We have migrated the `Settings` section of the Flow Designer page to React. In addition, the platform saves any setting changes once you click outside the focus area. Alternatively, you can still hit 'Save' at top right.
