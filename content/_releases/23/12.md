## Features

### Pub-sub support

On activaton recipe which contain topic - we create new topic in corresponding workspace.

### Transform UI for "Settings" page to React

We are moving the `Setting` section of the Flow Designer page to React page. Also, the design of the `Setting` section has been slightly changed, as you can see below:

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2312/rn2312-flows-settings.png" title="Flows settings" %}

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}
