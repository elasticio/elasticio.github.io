## New Features
### Dashboard Redesign:
The Dashboard is now enhanced to provide a more useful and intuitive selection of information regarding integration flows, executions, and errors. Specifically:
* Added Ordinary Flows counter - *click on the counter to open `Flows` page with filtered ordinary flows*
* Added Real-time Flows counter - *click on the counter to open `Flows` page with filtered real-time flows*
* Redesigned the current Execution Statistics graph - *each day on the graph is clickable and leads users to the corresponding page*
* Added new graph for Container errors - *each day on the graph is clickable and leads users to the corresponding page*
* Transferred the Workspace Quota Usage graph from the Quota page

### Workspace Memory Usage
 Clicking the workspace name in the `Workspace Memory Usage` list on the `Current Month Quota` page will now redirect the user to the corresponding workspace's Dashboard.

### Transfer modal windows to the new styles:
* Flow Designer UI changes: Configuration screens for the Content-Based Router are changed to React and now Users can map values from previous steps for evaluation.

### Removed `LOOKOUT_PROCESS_DATA` env var
`LOOKOUT_PROCESS_DATA` was introduced to disable Runlog for the dashboard. After redesigning the Dashboard page, this env var does not do anything on the frontend, since runlog is not on the new dashboard.

We've removed this env var from the frontend completely, and removed it from lookout by making it run as if this env var is set to "false".

### Change elasticsearch index config:

The search function is now more user-friendly as it now accepts partial matches (e.g. "test.123" log line previously would match only if a user searched for exact "test.123", but now both "test" and "123" will match the logline).

Also, we've fixed the bug where irrelevant search results appeared due to incorrect configuration of Elasticsearch.

**How to apply new changes to the mapping:**
1. Check if the custom mapping template is already installed
Send `GET http://{ELASTICSEARCH_IP}:9200/_template/exec-custom-mapping`

2. If `exec-custom-mapping` template already exists
If this template includes some additional configuration and mapping - you should include it in the request body as well and then send `PUT` request

3. If `exec-custom-mapping` template does not exist
Simply send `PUT` request

The request for adding or updating the template
`PUT http://{{ELASTICSEARCH_IP}}:9200/_template/exec-custom-mapping`

```
{
    "order": 0,
    "index_patterns": [
        "exec_*"
    ],
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "msg": {
                "analyzer": "simple",
                "type": "text"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
> *After the mapping template is updated, Graylog indices need to be updated as well. The best way is to just wait until they are rotated by Graylog itself (with the default config it should be 15 days). To check that the oldest index has correct mapping - send `GET http://{{ELASTICSEARCH_IP}}:9200/exec_602` (instead of `exec_602` put the oldest index from exec index set in Graylog) and find a mapping for msg filed - it should have type and analyzer from the updated custom mapping template.*
