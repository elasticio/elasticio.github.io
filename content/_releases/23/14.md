## IMPORTANT: New Releases Procedure
Kindly note that our release process is changing. In future, we will release updates once per month (in the last week of each month).
This change increases efficiency for the development teams and should not significantly influence delivery times for feature requests. In the current process, feature requests are groomed in 1 sprint, then implemented in the following sprint. In the new process, the grooming and implementation can be  executed within a single sprint.

_Note: AdditionalÂ releases are available in case of any critical hotfixes or urgent feature updates._

### Creating a values file for the platform chart for deploying on the secondary cluster
**Special Release Procedure (if haproxy is exposed**

Firstly deploy haproxy, and only then the platform. Otherwise, some services will crash.

Helm config changes:

1. Added `.Values.global.variables.SECONDARY_PLATFORM_CLUSTERS` to `admiral` chart in the next format
```
SECONDARY_PLATFORM_CLUSTERS:
  - name: 'secondary-cluster' # required
    credentials:
      name: 'my-user' # required
      password: 'some-password' # required
    disabled: false
    disabledRealtimeFlows: false
```

2. Added ability to disable replicated admiral services `.Values.global.services.{{SERVICE_NAME}}.enabled` (default: `true`)
3. Added annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4` to all internal load balancers if cloud provider is AZURE
4. Added `values-secondary.yaml` file to `admiral` and `platform` charts for disabling services that do NOT run on secondary clusters
5. Added ability in `deploy.sh` to deploy the platform to secondary cluster (i.e. using `values-secondary.yaml`). The command example:
```
KUBE_CONTEXT=great-moraq-stannis USE_SECONDARY=true ./deploy.sh deploy great-moraq
```
Changes required in configurations in k8s clusters (e.g. stage-clusters unmerged PR):
1. In `haproxy.yaml` add `expose: true` and `loadBalancerIp: "{{LOAD_BALANCER_IP}}"` 
2. In `platoform.yaml`:
  
    2.1. In `global.services.api` add `expose: true` and `loadBalancerIp: "{{LOAD_BALANCER_IP}}"` 
  
    2.2. In `global.services.maester` add `expose: true` and `loadBalancerIp: "{{LOAD_BALANCER_IP}}"` 
  
    2.3. In `global.services.steward` add `expose: true` and `loadBalancerIp: "{{LOAD_BALANCER_IP}}"` 
 
    2.4. In `global.services.pssLoadBalancer` add `expose: true`

3. In `secrets.yaml` change all occurrences of `haproxy-service.platform.svc.cluster.local` to an actual haproxy loadbalancer IP address
