## Features

### Webhook link copied by clicking on it
We simplify the Webhook link copying process. Now if you click on the Webhook link it wouldn't open in the new browser tab instead of it the link will be copied to the clipboard.

## Fixed Bugs

*   **FIXED** bug in the queue reader that can cause it to occasionally miss updates to the state of thread queues. This results in messages becoming stuck in the queue.
