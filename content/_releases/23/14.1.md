## Features

### Webhook link copied by clicking on it
We have simplified the process of copying the Webhook link. Clicking on the link will no longer open a new browser tab. Instead, the link will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Fixed Bugs

*   **FIXED** bug, where the queue reader sometimes misses changes in the state of thread queues that makes messages stuck in the queue.
