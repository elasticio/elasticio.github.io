## New Features
### Steps monitoring and limitation management service

The quota type per_contract_container_count_limit now controls the number of steps (including mapper) in active flows (both ordinary and real-time; in the running and sleeping states) per single contract. In simple words, the user can't start the flow if this quota is exceeded.

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Clear the `resourcerecords` collection. It is needed to perform a request for sync quota for all quotas with Service Account credentials after deploying: `POST /sidedoor/quotatxns/sync/container` (`container`, `user`, `workspace`, `flow`).*

### Restoring deleted flow
All deleted flows are stored in our database for 24 hours  after deletion by default (controlled by env var `WIPER_CLEAR_DELETED_FLOWS_AGE_SECONDS`).
We created a functionality that allows tenant-admin to restore the flow during this period.

We introduced new endpoints:
`GET /v2/flows/deleted?workspace_id=` - to get the list of deleted flows
`POST /v2/flows/:id/restore` - to restore the deleted flow
The new permissions are granted to the Tenant Admin role:
`tenants.flow.view_deleted`
`tenants.flow.restore`

See [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows)


### Filter flows by components on the Flows page

**Backend**

Added new filter`[component_id]` into `GET v2/flows endpoint` to search by component name in the workspace.
See [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows/get_flows).

**Frontend**

Added new filter "Component" to the Flows page. Using this filter the system will filter and display the flows that contain selected components. The filter is multi-select.

### Forbade to change the contract name for TRIAL contracts

Introduced new attribute `type: full (default) | trial` to the contract model. See [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/contracts).
If the contract is created through the registration page the type will be set to: `trial` by default. With this attribute change the contract name is forbidden.
Also, we performed the migration and set up the type `trial` for all contracts that have `TRIAL_` in the name or custom data.


## Fixed Bugs

*   **REMOVED** Unnecessary warning messages during component executions
*   **FIXED** Webhook requests with malformed paths crush the platform services
*   **FIXED** API doesn't validate the `log_level` value for the `v2/flows` endpoint. Now, allowed values are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. See [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows/patch_flows__flow_id)
