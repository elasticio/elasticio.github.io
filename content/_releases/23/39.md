## New Features
### Open Credentials, Configuration, Mapping and Sample sections on the full screen

We have added an expand window feature (square symbol) at the end of each indicated section to allow the user to open the required section to the full screen.

### Included descriptor for `GET` flow by `id`

`GET v2/flows/:id` now accept query parameter `include` with values `flow-containers`, `descriptor`.

[API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows/get_flows__flow_id_)

### Flow triggerer improvements

*   **IMPROVED** `queues-reader` service
*   **REDUCED** load to MongoDB

### Remove deprecated exec pages from the subscription to error emails

Now once the customer subscribes to flows error the link in the letter will redirect to the corresponding thread for component errors and the corresponding container for container errors.

### Use separate node pool for one-time-execs

To speed up the time response during step configuration we added a separate node pool for one-time executions.

* Create new envar KUBERNETES_ONETIME_EXEC_LABEL_VALUE: 'one-time'
Run one-time executions on separate node pool

* The default node pool for one time exec is ordinary. To change it - create a separate node pool with kubernetes labels: elasticio-role: `<lablel>`
{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2339/OTE.png" title="One-Time Executions" %}
Change the `deployment-handler` env var `KUBERNETES_ONETIME_EXEC_LABEL_VALUE` to `<label>`

### Health-check service for flow steps

Introduced significant enhancements, including improved step queue state retrieval from RabbitMQ, flow verification and Sailor versions mechanism checks, error notifications from the exporter API and health-check endpoint.

### Other improvements

*   **CHANGED** API response metadata for requests to `/v2/tenants/:tenantId/certificates`. [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/tenants) have been updated.

*   **ADDED** `Workspace is locked` page to Dashboard
*   **FIXED**  bug when unsynced `taskErrorRecordsCount` and `taskStatError` would lead to the removal of all `taskStatErrors`
