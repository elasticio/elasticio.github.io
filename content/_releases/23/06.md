## Features

Recipe create/edit (for tenant admin): Frontend.

## Impruvements

### New Recipes Articles

In connection with the latest updates to the recipes feature, we have updated and supplemented our articles on the topic of recipes. You can:

* learn about the [recipes] themselves, their [deployment] and [access rights]

* read guides on [Embedded recipe] and [Embedded recipe deployment]

* better understand how recipes work with the help of our [Use cases]

### Autostart flows on Recipe activation

We improved the behavior of` v2/recipes/:recipe_id/activate` endpoint.
Now you don't need to start flow after activating a recipe - created flows start after activation automatically.

## Fixed bugs

*   **FIXED** bug, where fake container errors in Runlog appears.

*   **FIXED** bug with recipe activation URL. We set back the recipe URL to `{base_url}/recipes/{recipe_id}`.

*   **FIXED** logs bug while copying multiple flows in Infobip cluster
