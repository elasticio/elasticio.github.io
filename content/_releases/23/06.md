## Features

### New Recipe create/edit UI features

As a continuation of the updates introduced in Release 23.04, we have added new features related to recipes:

* ability to select multiple flows to export to recipe

* update an existing Recipe

All the changes starts from the flow page. First you have to start with exporting a recipe:

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2306/rn2306-export-recipe.png" title="Export Recipe" %}

Then you can select multiple flows to export and then click on corresponding button:

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2306/rn2306-select-multiple-flows.png" title="Select multiple flows" %}

On new page you can configure your new recipe. You can name your recipe **(1)** and give it a description **(2)**. You can also give a description to credentials **(3)** and set up viability **(4)**. After finishing configuration click on **Save**:

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2306/rn2306-configure-export.png" title="Configure export" %}

You can also update an existing recipe. Find a recipe you want to update in drop-down list and select it:

>**Please Note:** During the configuration process, you will need to specify credentials for all components in the recipe where they are required.

## Impruvements

### New Recipes Articles

In connection with the latest updates to the recipes feature, we have updated and supplemented our articles on the topic of recipes. You can:

* learn about the [recipes] themselves, their [deployment] and [access rights]

* read guides on [Embedded recipe] and [Embedded recipe deployment]

* better understand how recipes work with the help of our [Use cases]

### Autostart flows on Recipe activation

We improved the behavior of` v2/recipes/:recipe_id/activate` endpoint.
Now you don't need to start flow after activating a recipe - created flows start after activation automatically.

## Fixed bugs

*   **FIXED** bug, where fake container error `The container could not be located when the pod was deleted. The container used to be Running` appears in Runlog.

*   **FIXED** bug with recipe activation URL. We set back the recipe URL to `{base_url}/recipes/{recipe_id}`.

*   **FIXED** bug when quota throw an error when copying multiple flows concurrently.
