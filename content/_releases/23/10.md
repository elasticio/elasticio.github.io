## New Features

### Integration flow "Scheduling" changes are now - autosaved

Changes to the cron scheduling of a flow are now saved automatically instead of requiring Users to hit 'Save'.

### Transform UI for "Implement" menu of Flow-designer to React

The Implement screen displays the flow definition. This screen is now updated to our new style and will be more responsive.

### Improve "Generate Stub Sample" functionality

We enable option `alwaysFakeOptionals` and disable `fillProperties` in `json-schema-faker` library, which is used by `Generate Stub Sample` button on UI
