## New Features

### Integration flow "Scheduling" changes are now - autosaved

Changes to the cron scheduling of a flow are now saved automatically instead of requiring Users to hit 'Save'.

### Transform UI for "Implement" menu of Flow-designer to React

The Implement screen displays the flow definition. This screen is now updated to our new style and will be more responsive.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2310/rn2310-implement.png" title="Implement" %}

### Improve "Generate Stub Sample" functionality

We enable option `alwaysFakeOptionals` and disable `fillProperties` in `json-schema-faker` library, which is used by the `Generate Stub Sample` button on UI

## Fixed Bugs

*   **FIXED** bug, where "container could not be located when the pod was terminated" errors in executions. Additional sporadic bugs related to 'hanging' or not starting flows are also addressed with this change.

>**Please note** that clients utilising outdated components may still experience sporadic issues. These issues will be resolved by updating to the most recent versions of the connector.
