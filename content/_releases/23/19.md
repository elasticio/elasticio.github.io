## Changes in accessibility to the `Recipe` feature
Starting from the next release `22.23` the `Recipe` feature will be available for the tenant-level of subscription. For other types of subscriptions, the `Recipe` feature will be available only if it was pre-paid in advance.

_Note: If you are interested to use the `Recipe` feature functionality please contact our support._

## New Features

### Ability to transform BigInteger values into a string

* We added new `node_config` option `consume_raw_data`. This parameter configures the parsing behaviour in the webhook step. In case it is true, webhook step receives input message in raw structure.
    * [API DOCS were updated](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows/post_flows)
* We added ability to enable `raw` in the Send Sample request.
* We added `Consume Raw Data` configuration for step in the `Advanced Settings` menu.

### Service "Bran" will store container reason

With this feature request `GET v2/containers` now returns `reason` and `exit_code` attributes.
This is a part of the platform optimisation and extending of its capability to withstand a high load. For this reason, we are moving forward to remove the Runlog and use new page "Containers" that will display relative information.

### Additional fields in OAuth2
Some of the services uses unusual authorisation schema so we added New Auth Client Type `oauth2_instagram`.

In the `component.json` of `REST API V2 component` you need to define the `scopes`, because `OAuthFieldView` does not allow to specify it in credentials. E.g.:
```
"authClientTypes": [
  "oauth2_instagram"
],
"credentials": {
  "fields": {
    "auth": {
      "required": false,
      "viewClass": "OAuthFieldView"
    }
  },
  "oauth2": {
    "scopes": ["user_profile", "user_media"]
  }
},
```
>_Note: `HTTPAuthView` does NOT support `oauth2_instagram` type._

### Transfer modal windows to the new styles: Transform UI for "Summary" page to React.
We applied a new design to the `Summary` tab on the Flow-Designer page and transfer it from ember to react.
