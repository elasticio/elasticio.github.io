## New Features

20.07 Platform Release

### New Logs Page

You can now see all the logs from one workspace on the dedicated logs page,
located near the executions page in analyze section of the navigational menu:

![Logs Page link](/assets/img/RN/20.07/logs-page.png)

While the most important logs are seen on the [executions](/getting-started/executions)
page, we decided no to spam you with everything else, and created a special page
for all the logs. The new page lists **all the logs for all the flows in the current workspace**.
Here you can filter the list by flow name, time, log level or use in-built
search to find the logs you were looking for. For more details check our
[logs page](/getting-started/logs-page).

As a back-end to the logs page we are introducing a new API endpoint (still experimental)
to request the same logs in the workspace. More about that in the
[Retrieve logs API endpoint](#retrieve-all-workspace-logs) section.

### New Mapper further improvements

You can now switch between Integrator & Developer modes in the new mapper without
losing any data that you have entered. However, if the root of the JSONata
expression is a function, switching to Integrator mode is not possible since the
Integrator mode has no functions support.

### Disable passthrough

For components, which use sailor version 2.6.0 and higher, you can now disable
passthrough during the flow creation/editing via the UI:

![Disable Passthrough](/assets/img/RN/20.07/disable-passthrough.png).

### OAuth2 for REST API component

Now you can use OAuth2 authentication method with the REST API component. Select
OAuth2 as credential type. There are four mandatory fields (`client_Id`,
`client_secret`, `auth_uri`, `token_uri`) and two optional (`scopes` and `additional parameters`).

## Fixed Bugs

## List Of Fixed Bugs

*   `FIXED`: When your component descriptor (`component.json`) had an empty triggers object it would have appeared in the triggers selection during the flow design but not usable at all. **Now we will not show that empty trigger of yours, you are welcome.**

*   `FIXED`: When working in the Developer mode of the mapper, while inputting a data you refreshed the screen or your browser session had expired, the data would have been lost. **Now your data is saved while you type.**

## Technical Details

### Retrieve all Workspace logs

As a back-end to the logs page we have a new, **still experimental** API endpoint `v2/logs`.
You can use this endpoint to request the same logs you see in the new logs page.

Here is the list of filters you can use with `v2/logs` endpoint:

*   `workspace_id`(required) -	The Workspace identifier
*   `flow_ids[]` - Flow identifier
*   `from` - Start Date of the period in `ISO 8601` format (`2020-01-12T14:50:42.215Z`)
*   `to` - End Date of the period in `ISO 8601` format (`2020-01-14T15:00:45.000Z`)
*   `search` - String to search in logs (searching string is wrapped by tag)
*   `offset` - Number of items to skip from the beginning (defaults to 0)
*   `limit`	- Number of items to return (**defaults is 100**)
*   `levels[]` - The logs level (1 - None, 10 - trace, 20 - debug, 30 - info, 40 - warn, 50 - error, 60 - fatal)

For more information about the endpoint visit our [API reference documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}docs/v2/#retrieve-all-workspace-logs).
