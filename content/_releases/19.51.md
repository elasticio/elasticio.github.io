## New Features

> **NOTE:** From this release we have adopted new release numbering format based
> on year and week of the release - `YY.WW`. `YY` are the last two digits of the
> year, and `WW` is the number of the week in that year. Following this template,
> our current release is `19.51`.

### UI

You can now retry failed messages using the new feature called **Retry**. Any
error emitted by a component can be retried if the flow is active. Error or success
entry appears in the current Runlog execution. Feature details can be found
[here](/guides/error-retry.html):

Also, now you can filter mapping view to see mandatory fields and hide optional fields:

### API

You can now disable [the passthrough](/getting-started/passthrough-feature) for
a selected flow step using an API call to the following endpoint:

`PATCH /v2/flows/:id`

> **NOTE** When the passthrough is disabled for a step, the platform would reset all the
> data from the previous steps and start again collecting the data from the steps from
> that step only.

This feature is available via an API call only. More details [here](#api-stuff).

### Other

#### Order of fields in component descriptor

Now you can configure the order of fields in `component.json` using the new numeric key `order` for:

-   output metadata
-   credentials
-   action/trigger
-   action/trigger order
-   action/trigger on recipe activation page
-   credentials on recipe activation page

For more details read the [component descriptor ordering fields](/references/component-descriptor-ordering-fields) document.

#### Custom scripts for individual tenants

Additionally, custom scripts for individual tenants can run on every page before
authorization:

-   Login pages
-   Forgot password pages
-   Register pages
-   Reset password pages
-   Invite page

#### Little bits

*   Component environment variables can have global visibility again.
*   The [deprecated](3.18.0) links `links.documentation` and `tenant.links` in the tenant description body are no longer supported.
