## New Features

### Frontend

You can now enjoy a better, more convenient UI navigation:

The *Quick Help* button opens a menu, which allows you to visit our product documentation page, or open a support chat:

The button with your initials opens your profile menu, where you can manage profile and SSH keys:

What's even better, you can now enjoy breadcrumbs navigation:

All in all, we improved the navigation to make it more intuitive. For example, you can now go directly to Flow Designer from Flow execution page. Also you can now see the mappings of a read-only Flow without the need to create a draft.

Additionally, you can now multiselect options in certain components, as we added `MultiSelectView` class for component fields. Details [here](#frontend-stuff).

> **IMPORTANT:** As of version 3.19.0, your company logo will be moved to the navigation panel. For proper display, please make sure that your logo complies with the following requirements:

- Logo size = 40x40 pixels

- Logo format - *.PNG* or *.SVG*

### Other

This is important. There is now `custom_links` instead of `links.documentation` in Tenant. Check out the details [here](#other-stuff).

## Fixed Bugs

### List Of Former Bugs

- Scrolling now works properly on Profile menu.

- `handlebars` mapper type for Debug task is officially gone, and won't confuse you anymore.

- Flows overview page does not automatically set the user filter when you are navigating to the page with the query parameter in URL

## Technical Details

### Frontend stuff

To use the new viewClass you need to add the class to component.json file, as "viewClass":"MultiSelectView" for certain field. Then you can select multiple items on the Frontend. Values will be passed in the configuration as an array.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
"triggers": {
    "getPetsByStatusWithGenerators": {
      "main": "./lib/triggers/getPetsByStatusWithGenerators.js",
      "type": "polling",
      "title": "Get Pets By Status With Generators",
      "fields": {
        "status": {
          "label": "Pet Status",
          "required": true,
          "viewClass": "MultiSelectView",
          "model": {
            "available": "Available",
            "pending": "Pending",
            "sold": "Sold"
          },
          "prompt": "Select Pet Status"
        }
```

### Other Stuff

We introduced `custom_links` field for Tenant, with the following format:

```
[
  {
      "url": "https://docs.example.com",
      "title": "Documentation",
      "icon": "description",
      "custom_class": "custom_class"
  },
 ...
]
```

| **Parameter**                    | **Required** | **Description**                                   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `url`                             | yes          | Link URL |
| `title`                  | yes          | Link text                       |
| `icon`   | no          | Icon name from [material-icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)                               |
| `custom_class`   | no          | Class added to `<a>` tag                              |

>**NOTE:** `links.documentation` is deprecated from now on. Support of `links.documentation` will be removed from the Platform in 3.23.0 release. Please be sure to [PATCH]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-tenant) your tenant with `"links": null` and move `links.documentation` to `custom_links`.
