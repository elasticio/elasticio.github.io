## Features

### Retry from Step

Up to this point, when an error occurred in the thread, you could exit the message and then initiate a retry at the step where the error occurred. With the platform release version {{page.version}} a feature with which you can select any previous step in the flow and start retrying from that moment. For more information please read this [article](/developers/error-retry#retry-from-step).

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2141/rn2141-retry-from-step.png" title="Retry From Step" %}

* Selects "Retry From" step from dropdown. You can select the current step and all previous steps.

* You can edit message to be inputted.

* You can click retry and flow starts from that point.

* You can not retry from trigger-step.

> **Please Note:**
* To retry your flow must be active
* If passthrought is disabled in a step, you will not be able to retry from previous steps.

### Informing about deprecated or not latest version

With the platform release version {{page.version}} we introduce a new feature that will inform you if your productive flows are using deprecated(**Exclamation Icon**) or not latest versions of components(**Cycle Icon**).

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2141/rn2141-informing-about-deprecated-or-not-latest-version.png" title="Informing about deprecated or not latest version" %}

In case there is a deprecated component in your flow, you will need to replace the old component with new one or use another trigger/action instead of deprecated one. If you just need to update your components to the latest version, you can use the **Update all components** feature:

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2141/rn2141-update-all-components.png" title="Update all components" %}

The API call also provides information about deprecated and outdated components.

## Improvements and Updates

The release {{page.version}} contains number of improvements under the hood which
are not obvious for the users. Our team worked hard to:

* Improve the look and feel of [Try Metadata Tool](\developers\try-metadata)
* Improved the alerting of fluentd to investigate the occasional overload cases

### Reduce list of component version

Previously, on the **Versions** tab of the component configuration, you could select any previously released version of the component. We decided to limit the selectable options in the UI to the `latest` and last 2 published versions. Of course, all versions remain selectable via the API. However, we discourage you to use older version of the components to ensure better performance of your flows.
{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2141/rn2141-reduce-list-of-component-versions.png" title="Reduce list of component version" %}

* If you had a old version selected it remains visible

* When you switch from old version it will disappear
