## Features

### Array-to-Array Mapping
You can now map array fields with the graphical UI using "New Mapping Experience". Mapping process is similar to a mapping of an object field, with few restrictions:

- You can map properties from only one array throughout array's children fields

- JSONata mode is disabled for an array's children fields

### Dynamic Flow Control
When you retry erroneous messages, they get marked with `retry=true` header, so lookout doesn't write data record.

Also, now sailor (version: `2.6.6`) retries publishing messages to next step infinitely, for those cases when the next queue is overloaded. Retries will happen with exponential backoff. For example, if it starts with retry in 5 seconds, the next will be in 10, then 20, then 40, then 80 seconds, etc. The maximum delay is configurable with an environment variable. By default, there is no limit to retries.
The following variables control the retry process:
1\. `AMQP_PUBLISH_RETRY_DELAY`: 100 ms
2\. `AMQP_PUBLISH_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: Infinity
3\.  `AMQP_PUBLISH_MAX_RETRY_DELAY:` 5 minutes.

### Publish-Subscribe

### Pub-Sub API
You can now use pub-sub topics via the new API endpoints:

* `POST /v2/workspaces/:id/topics` - creates a topic in the Workspace, requires `WORKSPACE.TOPIC.CREATE` permission

* `GET /v2/workspaces/:id/topics` - lists topics in the Workspace, requires `WORKSPACE.TOPIC.GET` permission

* `GET /v2/workspaces/:id/topics/:id` - get topic in the Workspace, requires `WORKSPACE.TOPIC.GET` permission

* `PATCH /v2/workspaces/:id/topics/:id`- update topic in the Workspace, requires `WORKSPACE.TOPIC.EDIT` permission

* `DELETE /v2/workspaces/:id/topics/:id` - delete topic in the Workspace, requires WORKSPACE.TOPIC.DELETE permission.
Body: usual JSONAPI, attributes: name, jsonschema, both required.

Details can be found [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}docs/v2/#what-is-a-topic-unit?).

## Improvements

### Better Component Versions
You will now have the de-facto latest Component version set as default. Previously, the default Component version was "Latest", meaning the Platform checked for the latest version. Now there is no automatic check, and the latest version at the point of Flow creation is selected.   

### 10,000 Log Records Limit Set
The confusing "next" button on the last page of log records list is now disabled. If you hover the cursor on it, you'll see the new tooltip that suggests you reduce your results number with filters.

### Large Samples Visualization
Improvements:
- Mapper `select items` filtering code moved to async worker
- Mapper `select items` is now an async operation (async computed in ember)
- Loader is displayed when filtering takes too long


## Fixed Bugs

* Removed the strange "no notification" message on gitreceiver logs

* Removed the console error that appeared when you change Component version

* Letters "wiper-flow-suspended-due-to-queue-overflow" are sent again

* Webhooks now don't insist on Content-Type for webhook POST actions when there is no body in the POST request
