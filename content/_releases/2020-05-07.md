## Features

### Array-to-Array Mapping
You can now map array fields with the graphical UI using "New Mapping Experience". Mapping process is similar to a mapping of an object field, with few restrictions:

- You can map properties from only one array throughout array's children fields

- JSONata mode is disabled for an array's children fields



## Improvements

### Fixed Component Versions
You will now have the de-facto latest Component version set as default. Previously, the default Component version was "Latest", meaning the Platform checked for the latest version. Now there is no automatic check, and the latest version at the point of Flow creation is selected.   

### 10,000 Log Records Limit Set
The confusing "next" button on the last page of log records list is now disabled. If you hover the cursor on it, you'll see the new tooltip that suggests you reduce your results number with filters.



## Fixed Bugs

* Removed the strange "no notification" message on gitreceiver logs

* Removed the console error that appeared when you change Component version

* Letters "wiper-flow-suspended-due-to-queue-overflow" are sent again

* Webhooks now don't insist on Content-Type for webhook POST actions when there is no body in the POST request
