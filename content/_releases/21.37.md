## Features

### Update components in all flow steps

We introduce a new feature to help update the components in all steps of your
integration flow in one go. A new button **Update All Components** will appear
in the flow designer if your flow has steps which run on older version of the
component.

{% include img.html max-width="80%" url="/assets/img/RN/2137/rn2135-update-all-components.png" title="Update All Components Button." %}

The following rules apply with this new feature:

*   The **Update All Components** button will appear in case when the flow draft has one or more steps using an older version of the component.
*   By clicking on this button the platform will upgrade all steps to use the latest available component version - not the `latest` alias.
*   If your flow has a step running an outdated component version, by clicking on the **Update All Components** button the system will create a new draft of this flow with an updated latest component version - not set the `latest` alias. You can review your flow and publish it essentially upgrading all steps.

### Try metadata tool

With the platform version {{page.version}} we decided to reveal one of our internal
tools our team uses to render the component metadata structures to see how they would
look on the platform UI. We hope this tool will be as useful for you as for our component
developer team.
