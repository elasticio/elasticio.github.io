## Features

### New "Grant Support Access" Button

With {{page.version}} we introduce a new capability to grant support access to
your workspace. Click on **Grant Support Access** button found in the workspace
setup page to add our support representative so he/she can help in troubleshooting.

When you no longer need this help you can click on **Revoke Support Access** button
to remove our representative from your workspace.

> Please note the button **Grant Support Access** changes into **Revoke Support Access** when
> you add the support representative to your workspace.

### Intercome Chat Icon

To make it easier to chat with us we placed the Intercom Chat Icon directly on
the left-hand-side menu for more prominence.

### Remove component versions

You can now remove versions of components using a new API endpoint
**DELETE** `/v2/components/{COMPONENT_ID}/versions/{GIT_REVISION}`. For more
information refer to the
[API documentation pages]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#delete-a-version-of-the-component).

You can delete any version of your component unless that particular version is in use
by any integration flow. In this case you will get an error listing the integration
flow IDs where this particular version is in use.


## Improvements and Updates

### Add Flow Info to disable emails for limited workspace.

Added a link to the flow into the letter template wiper-stop-limited-flow


### Dynamic flow control and JVM Sailor

You can disable the dynamic flow control for Java based component which use our
latest `sailor-jvm 3.3.5`. This feature is part of larger development effort to
ensure higher than average platform throughput. **For now, this is in experimentation and exploration phase.**

To disable it use the following parameter in the flow configuration:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "nodes_config": {
        "step_1": {
          "disable_dynamic_flow_control": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## OEM Related

News in this section are for our customers who use
[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### Tenant Administration Improvements

With this release we introduce a new API endpoint (**GET** `/v2/components/all`) to list
all exiting components in the tenant. This endpoint returns all components regardless of
the set visibility level (`Team` or `Tenant`). You can use an optional filter (`?contract_id`)
with this endpoint to get components in the given contract.

In back-end part, we introduced a new `tenants.component.list_all` permission to
control who can use the `/v2/components/all` API endpoint. By default the
`tenantAdmin` role holder has this permission.


### Grant Support Access Configuration

The introduction of **Grant Support Access** button on the workspace members page
comes with a necessary back-end configuration of support user. You have a
possibility to configure a support user at both contract and tenant level using
the `support_user_id` parameter. Patch the contract or tenant record and add the
user ID of the support user for this to work.

> Please note: You must use the user ID of the support user not his/her email address.
> Since you are setting up this role and the user, you can get the user ID with an API
> call to `/v2/users/me`.

For this feature we introduced the following API endpoints and functionalities:

*   **PATCH** `/v2/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/members/support` - with an empty body, which adds support user, which is defined in a contract or tenant to a workspace, as a member with **Owner** role. If support user is not a member of the corresponding contract he/she will be added to this contract with owner role as well.
*   **DELETE** `/v2/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/members/support` - removes the support user from workspace and contract, in case if it was the last workspace in this contract for support user.
*   We have also a new permission `workspaces.edit_membership_support` which is granted to the owner and the admin role holders in the workspace.
*   There is a new button on the Workspace Settings Page in case if `support_user_id` is set for the contract or tenant to which this workspace belongs. If the parameter is not set in both places - the button would not show.

### Registration and login page improvements


OPEN ID provider to be done with the API call.

We are working towards improving the registration and login pages. In this light,
we are introducing couple of new capabilities.

*   You can now define a unique logo for registration/login pages by adding a new `logoURL` parameter and point it the logo address you want to use. If you do not specify this parameter, the platform will use the standard `header_logo_url` value as fall-back.
*   You can now directly enable **Sign up with Google** or **Sign in with Google** options. You would need to provide the value for the `google_provider_id` parameter. If the value exist in the tenant configuration and it exist in the DB, then this will add an ability to authenticate with your Google account (register a new user and logging in the existed user).

You can use the following structure as en example to
[update the tenant configuration]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-tenant):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tenant",
    "attributes": {
      "signin_v_2" : {
        "logo_url": "https://cdn.example.com/logo-mini.png",
        "google_provider_id": "{{google_provider_id}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Intercom chat icon on the panel

Now you can place the Intercom Chat icon more prominently on the left-hand-side panel.
You can use the existing `customNavItems` capability and the following structure
while updating the tenant records:

```json
{
  "icon" : "forum",
  "customClass" : "intercom-launcher"
}
```
> Please note: If you need the Intercom Chat icon right above the user profile you must
> have this item the last listed in the `customNavItems` section of the tenant records.


### Use Google Tag Manager

You can now configure and use the Google Tag Manager services on your tenant.
To use this, update the tenant record parameter `google_tag_manager_id`
value and add your google Tag Manager container ID **without `GTM-` prefix**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tenant",
    "attributes": {
      "google_tag_manager_id":"XXXXXX"
    }
  }
}
```

{% endif %}

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixed inconsistency when step deletion was incorrectly reflected in the `nodes_config` part of the flow configuration. Now they will be reset to reflect correct step order.
*   Addressed UI crashes caused by deleting secrets which were used in the flow-drafts.
*   Fixed the delay in flow saving in cases when using components with custom metadata.
