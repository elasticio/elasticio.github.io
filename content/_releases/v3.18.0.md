Version 3.18.0 is full of new stuff. Let's see what we added for you in the following sections:

-   [New Features](#new-features)

-   [Fixed Bugs](#fixed-bugs)

-   [Technical Details](#technical-stuff)

### New Features

Check out the improvements in the following subsections:

-   [Frontend](#frontend)

#### Frontend
You can now enjoy a better, more convenient UI navigation:

The *Quick Help* button opens a menu, which allows you to visit our product documentation page, or open a support chat:

The button with your initials opens your profile menu, where you can manage profile and SSH keys:

What's even better, you can now enjoy breadcrumbs navigation:

All in all, we improved the navigation to make it more intuitive. For example, you can now go directly to Flow Designer from Flow execution page. Also you can now see the mappings of a read-only Flow without the need to create a draft.  

#### Other

This is important. There is now `custom_links` instead of `links.documentation` in Tenant. Check out the details [here](#other-stuff).


## Fixed Bugs

- Scrolling now works properly on Profile menu.

- `handlebars` mapper type for Debug task is officially gone, and won't confuse you anymore.

- Flows overview page does not automatically set the user filter when you are navigating to the query parameters page


## Technical Stuff

**WARNING!** Boring technical stuff ahead. Read only if you have to.

#### Frontend stuff




#### Other Stuff

We introduced `custom_links` field for Tenant, with the following format:

```
[
  {
      "url": "https://docs.example.com",
      "title": "Documentation",
      "icon": "description",
      "custom_class": "custom_class"
  },
 ...
]
```

| **Parameter**                    | **Required** | **Description**                                   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `url`                             | yes          | Link URL |
| `title`                  | yes          | Link text                       |
| `icon`   | no          | Icon name from [material-icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)                               |
| `custom_class`   | no          | Class added to <a> tag                              |

**NOTE:** `links.documentation` is deprecated from now on. Support of `links.documentation` will be removed from the Platform in 3.23.0 release. Please be sure to [patch]({{apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-tenant) your tenant with `"links": null` and move `links.documentation` to `custom_links`.
