## New Features
### Unified Data Display for Execution Statistics
We have synchronized the data displayed across our platform to ensure consistency and clarity:
* The `GET v2/threads/stats?workspace_id=` API endpoint now retrieves the same data as shown on the Execution page. This means users will see the total number of messages emitted by flows within a specific workspace, grouped by day (UTC time).
* The Dashboard's Execution Statistics graph now reflects the same message counts as the Execution page, providing a unified view of the data.

These updates ensure that users have a consistent and accurate overview of message activity across the workspace.
