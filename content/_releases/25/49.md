## New Features
### Base Image and Compatibility Update
We have made the following updates to improve compatibility and prepare for future changes:
* Added the environment variable `CONTAINERD_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_PULL_SCHEMA_1_IMAGE=1` to maintain compatibility with schema 1 images. This is a temporary solution and will be removed in containerd version `2.1`.

These changes ensure continued compatibility and prepare for upcoming updates, maintaining smooth operations and minimizing disruptions.

### Message Deduplication for Sailor NodeJS
Added logic to automatically identify and remove duplicate messages, improving data accuracy and processing efficiency.

_Note: This deduplication feature is currently not supported for step deployments. Please be aware of this limitation for the step deployments._

### Sailor JVM Update
We have implemented several enhancements and fixes to improve the concurrency, stability, and performance of the Sailor JVM:
* Added retry mechanism for publisher confirms on timeout to prevent message loss
* Refactored message publisher to use thread-local AMQP channels, resolving timeouts during high-throughput parallel processing
* Corrected a race condition in the graceful shutdown logic to prevent `Connection pool shut down` errors when stopping the component during an active HTTP request
* HTTP Client Improvements:
    * Ensured large message (lightweight) HTTP requests are repeatable for retries, preventing `NonRepeatableRequestException` on connection reset
    * Implemented a singleton strategy for the HTTP client to reuse connections and improve performance
    * Stabilized large message (lightweight) streaming by setting the `Content-Length` and disabling the `Expect-Continue` handshake, preventing `Connection reset` errors
    * Added a retry mechanism for `408` (Request Timeout) and `5xx` server errors
* Logging Enhancements:
    * Resolved logging conflicts that caused erroneous messages, duplicate or empty log messages
    * Improved logging for large message uploads to include the message's context (e.g., "main message body", "passthrough") and its size
    * Moved several verbose logs from `INFO` to `DEBUG` level for a cleaner default log output
* Dependencies:
    * Upgraded core dependencies, including Guice from `v5` to `v7`

## Fixed Bugs
*   **FIXED** an issue where some new components were failing to push using the component-pusher, ensuring all components are now successfully deployed
*   **FIXED** a problem where the component-pusher was not updating passwords from the `secrets.yml` Helm configuration, ensuring that all credentials are correctly applied during deployments
