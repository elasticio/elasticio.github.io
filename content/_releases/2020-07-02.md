## Features

### Custom error handling in flows

We introduce a new concept for error handling in the integration flows. Now you
have a possibility to choose what to do with errors. In short you can handle
those errors by building a workflow to catch them and store them in a most
convenient way for you.

Before you would get error reports when you subscribe to receive them per email
or if you would constantly checking your flows for errors on the platform UI by
logging in.

Now you can do both of these if you still prefer it, but you can proactively handle
those errors and decide what should happen with these errors and who should handle
them.

> **An important technical precondition:** The Node.js Sailor `2.6.13+` version is
> required for this mechanism to work. We recommend upgrading your custom Node.js
> components accordingly.

To use and customise error handling choose the icon presented in the right bottom
of the flow designer page after you configure the first step in the flow.

![Add Error Handling](/assets/img/RN/2027/add-error-handling.png "Add Error Handling")

You can choose to configure it right away or wait when you finish the flow design
and configure it to handle errors in one go since
**only one error handling is supported in this version**.

Here is how the completed flow with error handling would look. Note, it handled
the error in the third step.

![Handling Errors](/assets/img/RN/2027/handling-errors-result.png "Handling Errors")

In this example all errors in email components get redirected into a separate Google
spreadsheet document. We have a separate dedicated page describing how to
configure [custom error handling](/getting-started/custom-error-handling) based on this example above.

## Improvements

### Secrets Management Service Improvements

We continue our improvements and developments of the New Secrets Management
service. In this round we made great improvements on authentication parameters.

#### `auth_uri` and `token_uri` for OAuth2

Authentication clients for OAuth2 now support `auth_uri` and `token_uri` attributes
in credentials.

> **Please Note**: API-requests for auth-clients is different now. More iformation
> in [auth-clients-(experimental)](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2/#auth-clients-(experimental))
> section of API documentation.

#### Handling token expiration

Secrets Management Service refreshes tokens 60 second earlier than
`exires_in` parameter record to ensure the stability of the connection.

#### `expires_in` taken from `token_expires_in`

Now when you create a new secret linked to `auth-client` with a parameter `token_expires_in`,
the parameter `expires_in` gets the value from the `token_expires_in` data.

### Request-reply Response Code

From `1.1.0` version of [Request-Reply component](/components/request-reply) you
can add and configure the HTTP response code using the new **Response Code**
input field during the design phase. Response code is passed in the reply message
header. The default value is `200` by default.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Addresses the problem with mapper UI when objects in arrays were impossible to modify.
*   Addresses the empty title problem in pub/sub topic schema generation.
*   Fixes several internal issues connected with the logs delivery delays to UI.
