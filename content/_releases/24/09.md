## New Features
{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}
### Display component access level on the "Repositories" list
Enhanced the access levels visibility for the component by displaying directly on the [Repositories](https://docs.elastic.io/developers/teams-and-repos#access-and-visibility) list.

### Improved authorization for deleting `Production` Workspaces
Enhanced security measures by adding a confirmation step, requiring password authentication or OIDC provider verification, for sensitive actions such as deletion of `Production(Full)` workspaces via the `DELETE v2/workspaces/:id` endpoint, ensuring authorized access and preventing inadvertent actions.

[Learn more about sensitive actions](https://docs.elastic.io/getting-started/sensitive_actions_reauth.html)

### `thread_id` returned in Response Headers in case the HTTP Reply component fails
To improve the error tracking and debugging, the `thread_id` value is now returned as the `x-execution-id` in the response header when a flow Webhook-Reply encounters an error before the Reply step, facilitating easier identification and resolution of failed webhook interactions.

### Reduced the size of JSON schema for data samples on UI
Based on the feature from the previous [release](https://docs.elastic.io/releases/24/05.html#handle-large-data-samples-on-ui) we decided to reduce the maximum size of the data sample to 256 Kb.
