## New Features
### Enhanced Session Management
Users gain enhanced control over their sessions with the ability to manage and delete them. The system now retains the IP address and user agent information for each session, providing users with valuable insights into their account activity. 

To access these features, simply navigate to the Profile page and utilize the `Manage sessions` section, where you can view all current sessions and efficiently delete any unwanted sessions, offering a more personalized and secure user experience.

### Handle large data samples on UI
The platform will generate JSON schema instead of JSON for large data samples (>512 Kb) and generate the JSON sample from schema. The user will receive a warning notification about it.
