## New Features
<!-- ### Cloud-handler is used to get the current state of the running containers
To avoid data duplications we introduce a new API within the cloud-handler. 

The API endpoint responsible for returning statuses has been updated to proxy into the cloud-handler, ensuring a more streamlined and efficient process.

### Enhanced Session Management
Users gain enhanced control over their sessions with the ability to manage and delete them. The system now retains the IP address and user agent information for each session, providing users with valuable insights into their account activity. 

To access these features, simply navigate to the Profile page and utilize the `Manage sessions` section, where you can view all current sessions and efficiently delete any unwanted sessions, offering a more personalized and secure user experience.

### Handle large data samples on UI
The platform will generate JSON schema instead of JSON for large data samples (>512 Kb) and generate the JSON sample from schema. The user will receive a warning notification about it.
