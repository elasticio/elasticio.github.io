## New Features
### Transformed UI for "Workspace" page from Ember to React
The React styles were applied to the Workspace page and all pages inside.

### Export multiple flows via UI (backend part)
The new endpoint was added to copy multiple flows. 
See [API DOCS](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2#/flows/post_flows_copy_many) for more details.

### `Suspend Flow` button
Last part of the `Suspend Flow` feature:
Added `Suspend Flow` to the menu of a flow card
{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2401/FS.png" title="Gear menu item" %}
Added `Suspend Flow` button to the Flow Designer page
{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="/assets/img/RN/2401/FS1.png" title="Flow Designer" %}

*NOTE: For the suspended flow, it is prohibited to change the flow graph.*

### Timestamp fields in the `Contracts`
Added `created_at` and `updated_at` attributes to the `v2/contracts` on `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` endpoints.

## Fixed Bugs
*   **FIXED** Flows settings are not fully visible in the "View list" mode.
