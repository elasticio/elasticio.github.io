## 2019-09-25 - v3.20.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| September 25th, 2019 | Platform release v3.20.0 |


### Frontend (v3.20.0)

There is the new page with quota usages on the Navigation Panel, section Contract Settings:

![Navigation Panel - Quota Usages](/assets/img/RN/320/Screenshot_1.png)

### Recipes (v3.20.0)

You can now export a Flow to a Recipe via the following API endpoint:

`POST /v2/flows/:flow_id/export-to-recipe/`

Find more info about it [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#create-a-recipe-from-existing-flow).

To list all available Recipes, use the `GET /v2/recipes` endpoint. For the first iteration (until private/public Recipes will be introduced) the URL should contain the `contract_id`: `/v2/recipes?contract_id={{CONTRACT_ID}}`. You can read more about it [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#retrieve-all-recipes).

We changed the structure of `POST/PATCH /v2/recipes`, and the response structure of `GET /v2/recipes`. Check [this section]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#recipes-(experimental)) for details.

> **IMPORTANT:** Recipes are still beta, so we don't recommend using them with critical data or production.


### Other (v3.20.0)

There are new endpoints you can use to see quota statistics for all Workspaces in your Contract. Additionally, there are endpoints for per-Flow and per-Workspace resource usage control, and Workspace or Contract usage history display. See details [here](#other-stuff).

Also, you can now use `&ref` in JSONschema. However, reference by `$id` is still not supported.

### List Of Fixed Bugs (v3.20.0)

- Now `POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE /v2/flows/:id/draft` are only allowed with
`WORKSPACE.FLOW.EDIT` permission.

- Component data sample maximum provision time before timeout is 1 minute now.

- Also, we fixed the issue with wrong URL in the developer team invitation letter.

### Technical Details (v3.20.0)

#### Other Stuff

## 2019-08-28 - v3.19.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| August 28th, 2019 | Platform release v3.19.0 |

### Frontend (v3.19.0)

We are in a constant state of UI honing, to make it even more convenient for you. First of all, we fixed the navigational menu, so it does not hide if you move the cursor away from it. To close the menu, click "hamburger" icon again.

![Navigation menu fix](/assets/img/RN/319/NavMenu1.gif)

> **IMPORTANT:** Please don't forget that from now on your company logo will be moved to the navigation panel. For proper display, please make sure that your logo complies with the following requirements:

- Logo shape - square

- Logo size = 40x40 pixels (smaller logos will be centered with whitespace around them)

- Logo format - *.PNG* or *.SVG*

### Recipes (v3.19.0)

You can now use Recipes to simplify Flow creation. Basically, a Recipe is a template of a working integration Flow. It has the following conditions:

- A Recipe may not reference any credentials

- A Component in a Recipe must always be versioned

- Mapping expressions may contain variables to be replaced with values during Recipe activation. You can perform CRUD operations with Recipes and create a flow from a recipe using API. You can find examples [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#recipes-(experimental)). Please note that the section is an experimental API.

> **IMPORTANT:** Recipes are beta right now, so we don't recommend using them with critical data or production.

### Alerts (v3.19.0)

Not to let you waste any time, we have added handy alerts that will notify you of any important changes in your flows statuses:

- All Contract owners will receive emails upon exceeding 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% of resource usage quota

- All users that subscribed to errors on a particular integration Flow will receive an email if the Flow gets suspended


### Other (v3.19.0)

You can now send a sample request to Webhook. Here is the new process of Webhook setup:

1\. Generate a unique URL for the Webhook to post sample data to and present it in the UI

2\. Send a sample request to the given URL. Once the request has been sent, it is stored in the DB.

3\. The sample is retrieved by ID and is used for mapping. Sample URL is active for 10 minutes.

![Sample URL](/assets/img/RN/319/Sample.gif)

### List Of Fixed Bugs (v3.19.0)

We were totally dedicated to improvements this month, so all the discovered bugs were immediately fixed before going into production.

### Frontend stuff (v3.19.0)

Introduced `FRONTEND_NO_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES` config variable. If set to `"true"`, then frontend will use scripts, styles and fonts from the same domain, without external CDN usage. If you want to use external CDNs, do not specify this variable.

To customize the link that leads to Component creation instructions, when creating a new Repository, PATCH your Tenant with:
```
{
  "attributes":{
    "docs_base_url":"{URL_TO_DOCUMENTATION}"
  }
}
```

If `docs_base_url` is not specified the repository page docs link will set to default value.

![Docs Link](/assets/img/RN/319/DocsLink.png)

### Dockerized Slugs (v3.19.0)

This is very cool, but quite new and experimental, so use at your own risk!

You can now build components as docker images via Gitreceiver. Gitreceiver pushes images into docker-registry, then docker at k8s nodes pulls images from that docker registry to run them.

We introduced ksonnet component (`docker`) and 4 new parameters:

1\. `docker_registry_replicas` Just number of replicas of docker registry deployment. Clearly it should be greater then `1`. You can change this value any time you want.

2\. `docker_registry_secret_name`. Admiral will use this secret while creating pods as authorization secret in docker registry. This secret should be defined in `tasks` namespace, it should contain login/pass and server (see `docker_registry_uri`) for authorization in docker registry (`docker-registry` type).  Probably `elasticiotasks` value is good enough. Generally you can change this value, but:

*a) be sure than proper secret exists in `tasks` namespace.

b) be sure that you've restarted admiral after change.

c) It's better to remove previous secret only when all pods, that was defined with it will die. Otherwise that won't restart in case of failure.*

3\. `docker_registry_uri`. Value is used by gitreceiver to find out where to push newly built images and by admiral to create fully-qualified image name of docker image for pod. Typically value looks like this:  "http://$LOGIN:$PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:31000/elasticio". `$LOGIN` and `$PASSWORD` should be same as secret mentioned above. Secret also should reference to IP address and port. Port is arbitrary from NodePort range (30000-32000 in default K8S installation). We don't recommend changing it during installation runtime. URl's path -- anything you like. `elasticio` seems quite reasonable and I don't see any reasons to change it. Also, it is better not to edit this value during lifetime of installation. Host **MUST** be `127.0.0.1` for all installations.

4\. `docker_registry_http_secret`. Just a good random string of any length. Used by docker registry for its own crypto magic. Changes requires restart of all docker-registry pods.

Ksonnet scripts install everything and maintain all constraints between ksonnet entities. To push component as docker it's required to add `"buildType":"docker"` into component.json file in component repository.


### Other Stuff (v3.19.0)

We replaced `custom_links` field for Tenant with `custom_nav_menu_items`. PATCH your Tenant to display the "Quick Help" menu:

```
"custom_nav_menu_items":[
 {
   "title":"Quick Help",
   "icon":"help",
   "custom_class":"custom_class",
   "links":[
     {
       "url":"https://docs.{{site.data.tenant.name}}/",
       "title":"Documentation",
       "icon":"description"
     },
     {
       "title":"Help Center",
       "icon":"forum",
       "custom_class":"intercom-launcher"
     }
   ]
 }
]
```

![Quick help](/assets/img/RN/318/Screenshot_2.png)

URLs in `custom_nav_menu_items` now supports url parameters (`workspaceId`, `contractId`, `tenantId`, etc.). When a URL has placeholders http://custom-url?workspaceId={workspaceId}&contractId={contractId}, those placeholders are substituted with real parameters. `custom_nav_menu_items` supports a 2-level structure.

> **IMPORTANT:** The following Tenant configurations are deprecated now:
* `connectorCatalogUri`
* `flowCatalogCurrentProjectSpaceUri`
* `infoSupportUri`
* `infoVideoUri`
* `infoDocumentationUri`



## 2019-08-08 - v21

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| August 8th, 2019 | Components release v21 |

### [Netsuite Component](/components/netsuite/) (v21)

*  **IMPROVED** - Error messages have become more user-friendly and some additional information is
moved from errors thrown to logs.

## 2019-08-01 - v3.18.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| August 1st, 2019 | Platform release v3.18.0 |

### Frontend (v3.18.0)

You can now enjoy a better, more convenient UI navigation:

![UI navigation](/assets/img/RN/318/Screenshot_1.png)

The *Quick Help* button opens a menu, which allows you to visit our product documentation page, or open a support chat:

![Quick Help](/assets/img/RN/318/Screenshot_2.png)

The button with your initials opens your profile menu, where you can manage profile and SSH keys:

![Your profile menu](/assets/img/RN/318/Screenshot_3.png)

What's even better, you can now enjoy breadcrumbs navigation:

![Breadcrumbs navigation](/assets/img/RN/318/Screenshot_4.png)

All in all, we improved the navigation to make it more intuitive. For example, you can now go directly to Flow Designer from Flow execution page. Also you can now see the mappings of a read-only Flow without the need to create a draft.

Additionally, you can now multiselect options in certain components, as we added `MultiSelectView` class for component fields. Details [here](#frontend-stuff).

> **IMPORTANT:** As of version 3.19.0, your company logo will be moved to the navigation panel. For proper display, please make sure that your logo complies with the following requirements:

- Logo size = 40x40 pixels

- Logo format - *.PNG* or *.SVG*

### Other (v3.18.0)

This is important. There is now `custom_links` instead of `links.documentation` in Tenant. Check out the details [here](#other-stuff).

### List Of Former Bugs (v3.18.0)

- Scrolling now works properly on Profile menu.

- `handlebars` mapper type for Debug task is officially gone, and won't confuse you anymore.

- Flows overview page does not automatically set the user filter when you are navigating to the page with the query parameter in URL

### Technical Details (v3.18.0)

#### Frontend stuff (v3.18.0)

To use the new viewClass you need to add the class to component.json file, as "viewClass":"MultiSelectView" for certain field. Then you can select multiple items on the Frontend. Values will be passed in the configuration as an array.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
"triggers": {
    "getPetsByStatusWithGenerators": {
      "main": "./lib/triggers/getPetsByStatusWithGenerators.js",
      "type": "polling",
      "title": "Get Pets By Status With Generators",
      "fields": {
        "status": {
          "label": "Pet Status",
          "required": true,
          "viewClass": "MultiSelectView",
          "model": {
            "available": "Available",
            "pending": "Pending",
            "sold": "Sold"
          },
          "prompt": "Select Pet Status"
        }
```

#### Other Stuff (v3.18.0)

We introduced `custom_links` field for Tenant, with the following format:

```
[
  {
      "url": "https://docs.example.com",
      "title": "Documentation",
      "icon": "description",
      "custom_class": "custom_class"
  },
 ...
]
```

| **Parameter**                    | **Required** | **Description**                                   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `url`                             | yes          | Link URL |
| `title`                  | yes          | Link text                       |
| `icon`   | no          | Icon name from [material-icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)                               |
| `custom_class`   | no          | Class added to `<a>` tag                              |

>**NOTE:** `links.documentation` is deprecated from now on. Support of `links.documentation` will be removed from the Platform in 3.23.0 release. Please be sure to [PATCH]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-tenant) your tenant with `"links": null` and move `links.documentation` to `custom_links`.


## 2019-07-29 - v20

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| July 29th, 2019 | Components release v20 |

### [Google Spreadsheets component](/components/gspreadsheet/) (v20)

*  **FIXED** - Remove fields `spreadsheetId`, `spreadsheetUrl` from `Create new spreadsheet action`, as theirs inputs are not affect on new spreadsheet creation.

### [Filter Component](/components/filter/) (v20)

*  **IMPROVED** - Updated Action `Simple JSONata Filter`. `Assertion` Checkbox added: If checked, the checkbox adds Assertion functionality. Instead of doing nothing, the component will throw an error when the condition is not met

### [Postgresql Component](/components/postgresql/) (v20)

*  **IMPROVED**  - Updated action `SQL Injection` by adding `Number of retries in case of deadlock transaction` field.

You can specify the maximum number of retries, that is intended to help to solve
lock's issues in case of a deadlock transaction. The delay between retries is 1
second. Default value for this configuration field is 0, it means, that such
behavior is switched off (by default) and no any retry will be performed in case
of deadlock transaction.

### [Netsuite Component](/components/netsuite/) (v20)

*  **NEW** - introducing `Get New and Updated Objects Polling` generic trigger that polls NetSuite instance for new and/or updated objects (of any type available in the NetSuite).
*  **NEW** - introducing action `Lookup Objects` which looks for objects available in NetSuite with a  given criteria.
*  **NEW** - introducing action `Lookup Object By Id` which looks for an object by the provided Id.

*  **NEW** - introducing action `Upsert Object By Id` which either updates an object in NetSuite by a provided Id or inserts it as a new object if it does not exist.

All previously existed triggers and actions marked as deprecated, as they are
not match with OIH standards:

**Deprecated Trigger:**

*   Search entity (Please use Get New and Updated Objects Polling Trigger instead)

**Deprecated Actions:**

*   Lookup Customer (Please use Lookup Object By ID Action instead)
*   Lookup Invoice (Please use Lookup Object By ID Action instead)

## 2019-07-11 -v19

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| July 11th, 2019 | Components release v19 |

### [JDBC Component](/components/jdbc/) (V19)

## 2019-07-01 - v3.17.0

| Date | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| July 1st, 2019 | Platform release v3.17.0 |


### Frontend (v3.17.0)

Credentials management is now way better due to a few tweaks. First of all, you can now edit or delete credentials in the Designer. Secondly, you don't have to verify credentials any more. Of course, verification  protects Flows from invalid credentials. However, we thought that the step should be optional. So now you don't have to spend extra time on credentials verification, if you don't want to. Check the screenshots below to see how this looks in the UI.

- When creating new Credentials:

![](/assets/img/RN/317/Screenshot_1.png)

- when adding new credentials to a Component in a Flow:

![](/assets/img/RN/317/Screenshot_2.png)

Also, we changed the order in step configuration process. Now it goes as follows:

1\. Select the Component

2\. Choose version (optional)

3\. Choose Trigger/Action

3\. Choose credential (or choose Agent, if the Component does not have credentials)


### Other (v3.17.0)

Now all Flows will start and stop faster, taking less time between clicking start or stop in the UI, than they did earlier. If you are interested in details, you can find them [here](#other-stuff).

You can now change metadata for your Platform HTML page, like [this](#other-stuff).

Additionally, we tweaked scaling a bit, adjusting the mechanism of graceful platform application scaling. This means you won't get the old deployment/scaling errors.


### Fixed Bugs (v3.17.0)

- We were totally dedicated to improvements this month, so all the discovered bugs were immediately fixed before going into production.


### Technical Stuff (v3.17.0)

**WARNING!** Boring technical stuff ahead. Read only if you have to.

#### Frontend stuff (v3.17.0)

*"Please, configure all steps in order to save the flow"* message replaced with alert. It shows in case of non-configured components in a flow.


#### Other Stuff (v3.17.0)

So, now the API call is made immediately after you've clicked start/stop. Obviously, this improvement boosts "reaction" time. Additionally, we reduced latency between message emitted in first step by scheduler or Webhooks, and the actual pod start.

To change metadata add the following attributes to
`POST /v2/tenants` and `PATCH /v2/tenants`:

```json
{
  "data":{
    "type":"tenant",
    "attributes":{
      "html_meta":{
        "description":"I am a description",
        "keywords":[ "hotdog", "burger", "sandwich" ],
        "author":"Acme Corporation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
