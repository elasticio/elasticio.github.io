## Features

### Regenerate Platform REST API Key

You can now regenerate your API key you use to communicate with the platform REST
API. You have two options, either do it in the platform UI or via an API call.

> **Please Note** Generating a new API key will replace the existing API key. If
> a new API key is generated, then API calls made with the old API key will fail.



### 2FA

Everything about 2fA and how to use it.

### Component Whitelisting

With the platform {{page.version}} version we introduce a new feature called **Component Whitelisting**.
In verbatim this means we can enable or disable certain integration components in
each contract based on the list of components - the Component Whitelist. If the
[component whitelist is enabled](#enabling-component-whitelisting) in the tenant
the following rules would apply in each contract:

*   You have access to all components available in your tenant while working in the developer (limited) workspaces.
*   You can only build integration flows using the available components (whitelisted components) in your production workspaces. Not included components would not show in your production workspaces while building an integration flow.
*   You can not export an integration flow from the developer workspace to production workspace if the flow contains a component not included in the whitelist.
*   You can not create a recipe with a contract level access when the recipe uses a component not included in the whitelisted components for the contract.
*   The developer workspace will not be converted to a production workspace in case when at least one step of one flow in your developer workspace uses not whitelisted component.

## HELM3

We are in middle of constantly improving various aspects of HELM3 deployments in
collaborations with our partners. These are updates and improvements done in
this round.

### Kubernetes Namespaces

With {{page.version}} release we remove Kubernetes namespace hard-coding from our
charts to integrate the platform into more Enterprise friendly infrastructures.

> **IMPORTANT** To deploy the platform version {{page.version}} on top of your existing cluster
> **you would need to re-create the entire kubernetes cluster**. We recommend to announce
> maintenance run since **the platform would be down for 10-15 minutes**.

Here are the steps necessary for a successful platform deployment:

1.  Delete existing namespaces OR uninstall helm release (**IMPORTANT: this step will delete the cluster**).
2.  Create following namespaces in kubernetes cluster (the `name` and `labels.name` should be equal to values provided in the `values.global.namespaces` of HELM3 charts):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    name: <monitoring_namespace_name_from_values>
  name: <monitoring_namespace_name_from_values>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    name: <platform_namespace_name_from_values>
  name: <platform_namespace_name_from_values>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    name: <tasks_namespace_name_from_values>
  name: <tasks_namespace_name_from_values>
```
The labels are important to platform's network functionality.
3.  Install the helm release.

### AWS Network Load Balancer support

Platform version {{page.version}} includes the support of the AWS Network Load
Balancer for ingress `LoadBalancer`. Here are the details of this change:

1.  We introduce a new storage type (for the AWS cloud provider) `aws-efs-csi-driver`. This means the **AWS EFS** storage type is supported in case when **Amazon EFS CSI driver** is installed on the EKS cluster. You can see more details in the [Amazon EFS CSI driver configuration documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html). Here is an example configuration for your guidance:
```yaml
storage:
    slugsSubPath: “slugs”
    stewardSubPath: “steward”
    storageClassName: “platform-storage-slugs”
    persistentVolumeClaimName: “platform-storage-slugs-volume-claim”
    type: “aws-efs-csi-driver”
    config:
      name: “platform-storage-slugs-volume”
      path: “/pss”
      size: “20Gi”
      gid: 1502
      fileSystemId: fs-03f24358 # AWS EFS file system ID
```

2.  We added the parameter for the AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB). Use `global.cloudProvider: AWS` in your configuration to enable this (HELM3 values).
3.  We added also support for the **Secured docker registry**. To enable the following configuration must be provided in the HELM3 chart:
```yaml
global.services.dockerRegistry.secured: true
global.services.dockerRegistry.tlsSecretName: "docker-registry-tls"
global.services.certificates.dockerRegistry.name: "docker-registry-tls"
global.services.certificates.dockerRegistry.key: "<<base64 encoded key>>"
global.services.certificates.dockerRegistry.crt: "<<base64 encoded certificate>>"
```

**Please Note:**

*   Certificate CN should match domain name specified in the `global.services.dockerRegistry.loadBalancerIp`,
*   The docker registry load balancer does not support external load balancer type yet. Created domain must be bound to the private ip address.


### Make namespaces creation optional in helm3

### Helm: re-deploy service if config-map or secret was changed

### Support HTTPS for docker registry URI

[OEM version of the elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io/saas-embedded-integration/).

### ClickHouse replication instructions

To facilitate installation of ClickHouse and the required dependencies to run in
the High Availability mode we added the following documentation pages:

*   [ClickHouse Installation](https://on-prem.elastic.io/installation/clickhouse-installation)
*   [Zookeeper Installation](https://on-prem.elastic.io/installation/zookeeper-installation)
*   [HAProxy Installation](https://on-prem.elastic.io/installation/haproxy-installation)

### Enabling Component Whitelisting

The newly introduced [Component Whitelisting](#component-whitelisting) feature
includes changes and parameters only accessible to the tenant administration. Before
you can use the component whitelisting you must enable a dedicated tenant level
parameter (switch) `attributes.feature_flags.contract_component_whitelist`. Set it to `true`
using a `PATCH` to `/v2/tenants/{TENANT_ID}` record (admin access).

## Fixed Bugs

*   Impossible to join the Contract via invitation letter in case login with OIDC
*   Invalid '0' value in the required fields with type 'number'
*   Maester's Redis leaves incomplete object keys and Maester thinks it's OK.
