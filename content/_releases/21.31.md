## Improvements and Updates

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We are in middle of constantly improving various aspects of HELM3 deployments in
collaborations with our partners. These are updates and improvements done in
this round.

### Kubernetes Namespaces

With {{page.version}} release we remove Kubernetes namespace hard-coding from our
charts.

> **IMPORTANT** : Before you deploy this version you must add the following
> annotation to all existing Kubernetes namespaces:

```yaml
annotations:
    helm.sh/hook: pre-install
    helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation
    helm.sh/hook-weight: "0"
```

Edit namespaces through `kubectl` command before deployments. **Failure to do so would result in complete platform removal and platform downtime.** To disable automatic namespace creation you need to set `global.namespaces.enabled` to
`false` (default is `true`).



### Support AWS Network Load Balancer for ingress LoadBalancer

### Add Software Version Info to Platform

### Make namespaces creation optional in helm3

### Helm: re-deploy service if config-map or secret was changed

### Support HTTPS for docker registry URI
