## New Features

### Recipes

You can now manage [Recipe](/getting-started/recipes.html) visibility with the new API endpoint `PATCH v2/:recipe_id/visibility`. This action is only available to users with proper permissions, and can be applied to components visible to them. See details [here](#recipes-stuff).

Also, you can now use Recipe details page (replace variables with corresponding data):

```
app.{{site.data.tenant.name}}/c/:contract_id#/w/:workspace_id/recipes/:recipe_id
```

Recipe descriptions support markdown syntax, except for checkboxes. Images for the page are hosted by Recipe author.

Another page for Recipes UI is Recipe activation page (replace variables with corresponding data):

```
app.{{site.data.tenant.name}}/c/:contract_id#/w/:workspace_id/recipes/:recipe_id/activate
```

It contains Recipe variables fields and Component sections listed with Credentials. Here you can choose existing Credentials, create new or edit existing ones during Recipe activation. Some data will require manual configuration: Credentials, Fields, Flow Variables.

### Quota

You can now see monthly quota history and quota usage of a Contract on the corresponding page:

![Quota Overview Page](/assets/img/RN/321/quota-overview.gif)

See details on quota history [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#retrieve-a-usage-history-for-a-contract).

### Other

You can now manage [Snapshots](/getting-started/snapshot-overview.html) via the API. The list of endpoints is [here](#other-stuff).

Also, we have added [reference by ID](#other-stuff) in Component metadata JSON Schema.

Another **IMPORTANT** thing - Docker Registry service doesn't run under the root user any more and requires migration. See instructions [here](#docker-migration). Please note that this is crucial, and **without migration the Platform will fail**.

## Fixed Bugs

### List Of Fixed Bugs

- `GET Flows-Versions` and `CRUD` with Flow draft are now available only to Workspace members.

- Dropdown lists of numbers in Components are now displayed correctly.

- Now errors are grouped by input message and error message.

## Technical Details

### Recipes Stuff

You can find the corresponding API doc [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#update-a-recipe-visibility)). `POST v2/recipes` and `PATCH v2/recipes/:id` do not have `attributes.visibility` anymore. Instead, new Recipes are created with the default visibility set for the Workspace. See more details [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#accessing-and-sharing-recipes).

Changing Recipe visibility requires certain permissions, depending on visibility level: **Workspace, Contract, Tenant, Global.**

### Other stuff

API endpoints for Snapshots:

- `GET /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots`

- `GET /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/$stepId`

- `POST /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/`

- `PATCH /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshosts/$stepId`

- `DELETE /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/$stepId`

You can find the corresponding API docs [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiBaseUri}}/docs/v2/#snapshots).

As for JSON Schema reference by ID:

```
{
  “definitions”: {
    “address”: {
      “$id”: “#address”,
      “type”: “object”,
      “properties”: {
        “street_address”: { “type”: “string” },
        “city”:           { “type”: “string” },
        “state”:          { “type”: “string” }
      },
      “required”: [“street_address”, “city”, “state”]
    }
  },
  “type”: “object”,
  “properties”: {
    “billing_address”: { “$ref”: “#address” },
    “shipping_address”: { “$ref”: “#address” }
  }
}
```

### Docker Migration

The migration has to be run AFTER deploying the release, where the `docker-registry` is being run as non-root. If the old version of the `docker-registry` (with root) was run, just to deploy the new version, remove the old migration job and run the migration again.

The  official registry (`registry:2.7.1` or mirror `elasticio/registry:2.7.1`) is being run as a `root`, `elasticio/registry:2.7.1-non-root` is being  run as `docker`. Our migration contains an update of ownership of files according to changed user (`root`->`docker`), and is implemented as kubernetes job  (i.e. it has to be run  only once).

Specify the `YOUR_CONTEXT` below and execute:

```shell
cat << EOM | kubectl create --context YOUR_CONTEXT --namespace platform  -f -

                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
EOM
```

To check the success, create new build and publish it:

```
shell
kubectl --context YOUR_CONTEXT --namespace platform exec  -it  docker-registry-INSERT_CERTAIN_POD_POSTFIX -- sh -c "ls -la /var/lib/registry"
```

It must contain `docker   docker`:

```
drwxr-xr-x    3 docker   docker        4096 Aug  7 19:01 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Oct  4 15:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x    3 docker   docker        4096 Aug  7 19:01 docker
```
