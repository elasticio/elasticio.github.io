## Features

### Custom error handling in flows

> **Please Note, this feature is only available when the new mapper component
> with Sailor `2.6.13` version is installed in the system.**

We introduce a new concept for error handling in the integration flows. Now you
have a possibility to choose what to do with errors. In short you can handle
those errors by building a workflow to catch them and store them in a most
convenient way for you.

Before you would get error reports when you subscribe to receive them per email
or if you would constantly checking your flows for errors on the platform UI by
logging in.

Now you can do both of these if you still prefer it, but you can proactively handle
those errors and decide what should happen with these errors and who should handle
them.

To use and customise error handling choose the icon presented in the right bottom
of the flow designer page after you configure the first step in the flow.

![Add Error Handling](/assets/img/RN/2027/add-error-handling.png "Add Error Handling")

You can choose to configure it right away or wait when you finish the flow design
and configure it to handle errors in one go since
**only one error handling is supported in this version**.

Here is how the completed flow with error handling would look. Note, it handled
the error in the third step.

![Handling Errors](/assets/img/RN/2027/handling-errors-result.png "Handling Errors")

In this example all errors in email components get redirected into a separate Google
spreadsheet document.

####  Preconditions

In case when your custom component is not using a system-wide mapper component
right before to map the fields, then it will not show in the component chooser
as a method to process your errors. **You can overcome this by upgrading your custom component Node.js Sailor to at least `2.6.13` version.**

At this moment the components which do not require mapper component input to
function would not show in the components list to choose.

#### Limitations

At the moment the Custom Error Handling works for limited use cases and errors.
For example it can not handle the following cases:

*   "Container failed to start" by request-reply as error handler. It causes request timeout on webhook.
*   "Container failed to start" original error messages.

The incoming metadata from the Custom Error Handling is hard-coded. It has the
following structure:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "Error message",
        "name": "Error name",
        "stack": "Error stack trace"
    },
    "errorInput": {
      "properties": {
            "headers": { "header":"value" }
        },
        "content": {
            "headers": { "header":"value" },
            "body": {}
        }
    }
}
```


## Improvements

### Secrets Management Service Improvements

We continue our improvements and developments of the New Secrets Management
service. In this round we made great improvements on authentication parameters.

#### `auth_uri` and `token_uri` for OAuth2

Authentication clients for OAuth2 now support `auth_uri` and `token_uri` attributes
in credentials.

> **Please Note**: API-requests for auth-clients is different now. More iformation
> in [auth-clients-(experimental)](https://api.elastic.io/docs/v2/#auth-clients-(experimental))
> section of API documentation.

#### Handling token expiration

Secrets Management Service refreshes tokens 60 second earlier than
`exires_in` parameter record to ensure the stability of the connection.

#### `expires_in` taken from `token_expires_in`

Now when you create a new secret linked to `auth-client` with a parameter `token_expires_in`,
the parameter `expires_in` gets the value from the `token_expires_in` data.

### Request-reply Response Code

From `1.1.0` version of [Request-Reply component](/components/request-reply) you
can add and configure the HTTP response code using the new **Response Code**
input field during the design phase. Response code is passed in the reply message
header. The default value is `200` by default.

## Fixed Bugs

*   Fixes the problem when newly created credentials would disappear and appear after UI refresh.
*   Addresses the problem with mapper UI when objects in arrays were impossible to modify.
*   Addresses the empty title problem in pub/sub topic schema generation.
*   Fixes several internal issues connected with the logs delivery delays to UI.
