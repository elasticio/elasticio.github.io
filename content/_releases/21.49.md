## Features

### New design for Flows page

As we announced in the last release, are ready present you a new design for Flows page. We tried to make the interface even more understandable and intuitive, and also added some important information. Now on the flow card you can see not only the date of the last publication, but also who and when created this flow. Here you can see what changes have been made:

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/RN/2147/rn2147-flows-page-new1.png" title="New Flows Card" %}
Picture shows the flow card changes.

Picture shows the flow card menu changes.

> For more informations on flow management please visit our documentation [page](/guides/managing-flows/).

### New flow Slide Out design

We decided to make some flow Slide Out design changes. Now the step configuration menu is fixed under the flow panel, and it will also be tied to the specific step that you are editing. This will be especially useful in the case of "wide" flows, where you will always see exactly the step that you are configuring.

## Improvements and Updates

### UI performance on the flow designer page

In order to speed up the work of the flow draft page, we decidedyt to create a caching system. We added `if-none-match` by default header to the API proxy mechanism to improve responses caching on the client-side.

{% if site.data.tenant.name == "elastic.io" %}

## HELM3

We constantly improve different aspects of HELM3 deployments in collaborations
with our partners. This section lists updates and improvements done in this round.

### Tag api-docs with platform version
We removed `global.apiDocsImage` from the helm values and se platform version for api-docs image.

From now you don't need specify manually api-docs image commit hash in k8s-clusters. When you deploy any platform version you can be sure that api-docs corresponds to a given platform release.
