## Product update - v3.21.0

**Released: 2019-10-30**

*   [Features](#features-v3210)
*   [Improvements](#improvements-v3210)
*   [Components](#components-v3210)

### Features (v3.21.0)

#### Recipes (v3.21.0)

You can now manage [Recipe](/getting-started/recipes) visibility with the new
API endpoint `PATCH v2/:recipe_id/visibility`. This action is only available to
users with proper permissions, and can be applied to components visible to them.

Also, you can now use Recipe details page (replace variables with corresponding data):

```
app.{{site.data.tenant.name}}/c/:contract_id#/w/:workspace_id/recipes/:recipe_id
```

Recipe descriptions support markdown syntax, except for check-boxes. Images for
the page are hosted by Recipe author.

Another page for Recipes UI is Recipe activation page (replace variables with corresponding data):

```
app.{{site.data.tenant.name}}/c/:contract_id#/w/:workspace_id/recipes/:recipe_id/activate
```

It contains Recipe variables fields and Component sections listed with Credentials.
Here you can choose existing Credentials, create new or edit existing ones during
Recipe activation. Some data will require manual configuration: Credentials, Fields, Flow Variables.

You can find the corresponding API doc [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipes/patch_recipes__recipe_id__visibility). `POST v2/recipes` and `PATCH v2/recipes/:id` do not have `attributes.visibility` anymore. Instead, new Recipes are created with the default visibility set for the Workspace. See more details [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/recipes/patch_recipes__recipe_id__visibility).

Changing Recipe visibility requires certain permissions, depending on visibility
level: **Workspace, Contract, Tenant, Global.**


#### Quota (v3.21.0)

You can now see monthly quota history and quota usage of a Contract on the corresponding page:

![Quota Overview Page](/assets/img/RN/321/quota-overview.gif)

See details on quota history [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/quota%20usages/get_quota_usages_contracts__contract_id__history).

#### Manage Snapshots via API (v3.21.0)

You can now manage [Snapshots](/getting-started/snapshot-overview) via the API.

API endpoints for Snapshots:

*   `GET /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots`
*   `GET /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/$stepId`
*   `POST /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/`
*   `PATCH /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshosts/$stepId`
*   `DELETE /v2/flows/$flowId/snapshots/$stepId`

You can find the corresponding API docs [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/snapshots).

#### Reference by ID in component metadata

Also, we have added [reference by ID](#other-stuff) in Component metadata JSON Schema.

As for JSON Schema reference by ID:

```
{
  “definitions”: {
    “address”: {
      “$id”: “#address”,
      “type”: “object”,
      “properties”: {
        “street_address”: { “type”: “string” },
        “city”:           { “type”: “string” },
        “state”:          { “type”: “string” }
      },
      “required”: [“street_address”, “city”, “state”]
    }
  },
  “type”: “object”,
  “properties”: {
    “billing_address”: { “$ref”: “#address” },
    “shipping_address”: { “$ref”: “#address” }
  }
}
```

#### Docker Registry Migration (v3.21.0)

Another **IMPORTANT** thing - Docker Registry service doesn't run under the root
user any more and requires migration. Please note that this is crucial, and
**without migration the Platform will fail**.

The migration has to be run AFTER deploying the release, where the `docker-registry`
is being run as non-root. If the old version of the `docker-registry` (with root)
was run, just to deploy the new version, remove the old migration job and run the
migration again.

The  official registry (`registry:2.7.1` or mirror `elasticio/registry:2.7.1`)
is being run as a `root`, `elasticio/registry:2.7.1-non-root` is being  run as
`docker`. Our migration contains an update of ownership of files according to
changed user (`root`->`docker`), and is implemented as kubernetes job  (i.e. it
has to be run  only once).

Specify the `YOUR_CONTEXT` below and execute:

{% raw %}
```sh
cat << EOM | kubectl create --context YOUR_CONTEXT --namespace platform  -f -

                        ]

                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
EOM
```
{% endraw %}


To check the success, create new build and publish it:

```
shell
kubectl --context YOUR_CONTEXT --namespace platform exec  -it  docker-registry-INSERT_CERTAIN_POD_POSTFIX -- sh -c "ls -la /var/lib/registry"
```

It must contain `docker   docker`:

```
drwxr-xr-x    3 docker   docker        4096 Aug  7 19:01 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Oct  4 15:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x    3 docker   docker        4096 Aug  7 19:01 docker
```

*   [Components](#components-v1951)


> **NOTE:** From this release we have adopted new release numbering format based
> on year and week of the release - `YY.WW`. `YY` are the last two digits of the
> year, and `WW` is the number of the week in that year. Following this template,
> our current release is `19.51`.

### Features (v19.51)

#### Retry failed messages (v19.51)

You can now retry failed messages using the new feature called **Retry**. Any
error emitted by a component can be retried if the flow is active. Error or success
entry appears in the current Runlog execution. Feature details can be found
[here](/developers/error-retry.html):

![Retry feature in action](/assets/img/integrator-guide/instant-error-management/edit-retry-error.gif)

Also, now you can filter mapping view to see mandatory fields and hide optional fields:

![Hiding optional fields](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/hide-optional-fields.gif)

#### Disable passthrough API (v19.51)

You can now disable [the passthrough](/getting-started/passthrough-feature) for
a selected flow step using an API call to the following endpoint:

`PATCH /v2/flows/:id`

> **NOTE** When the passthrough is disabled for a step, the platform would reset all the
> data from the previous steps and start again collecting the data from the steps from
> that step only.

This feature is available via an API call only and here is the schema of the
passthrough toggling request body:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "flow",
        "id": "5de7d63a944b750013fb3f09",
        "attributes": {
            "nodes_config": {
                "step_2": {
                    "passthrough": {
                        "disabled": true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Improvements (v19.51)

#### Order of fields in component descriptor (v19.51)

Now you can configure the order of fields in `component.json` using the new numeric key `order` for:

-   output metadata
-   credentials
-   action/trigger
-   action/trigger order
-   action/trigger on recipe activation page
-   credentials on recipe activation page

![Ordering fields in component.json](/assets/img/RN/323/field-order.png)

For more details read the [component descriptor ordering fields](/references/component-descriptor-ordering-fields) document.
