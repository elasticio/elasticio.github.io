This document introduces the [passthrough feature](#what-is-passthrough),
explains [why would you use it](#passthrough-usage), and gives a
[real-life example](#real-life-example) on how to use it.

## What is passthrough

Most components in an [integration flow](integration-flow) receive, process and
send data. Incoming data typically differs from the outgoing one, so the
last step may receive a message without even a small trace of the initial data.
If you want a component to map data other than what it receives from the previous
step, you can use the passthrough feature.

> feature for a content enrichment purposes.

With this feature enabled you can *pass-it-through* the data from the
component not only to the next step but to the step after that and thereafter. This
means you can use and reuse the data of any particular step along with the
integration flow several times.

Basically, passthrough maintains copies of all messages per step in the flow, and
adds them to each following message. This way, data received by *Step 4* will
contain the message sent by *Step 3*, and a special section with the messages
received by *Step 1*, *Step 2* and *Step 3*. Here is how it looks schematically:

![Passthrough schematics](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/passthrough-schematics.png)

The schematics above shows the passthrough feature in the flow. Without this
feature the *Step 4* reads and processes the data sent by *Step 3*, but you can
configure it to choose a messages from any other previous steps, if required.

## Passthrough Usage

An ability to access the data on different steps of the integration flow and
combine them into one outgoing message is an important advantage for many
integration use-cases. Here are some scenarious when the passthrough feature makes
a significant difference.

*   As an integrator you want to retrieve the data from more than one external resource and combine it into one outgoing message to store it in your desired storage. Without the passthrough feature you would need to retrive the data separately from different resources, synchronize them and store in the storage. For this you would definetly need to use more than one integration flow and make sure not overwrite it every time.
*   As an integrator you would like to retrive the data at least two times from the third party resource due to limitations of the third party API abilities. Without the passthrough you would need to use two different initegration flows and somehow synchronize the information between them.

Let us have a look into an example on how the passthrough feature can help to solve
a real-life integration dilemma.

## Beginner's Example

In this example, we want to update the status of a pet named Gromit in the pet store. We need to send information about changing the status of the pet to the bossâ€™s mail using the E-mail component. To accomplish the task, we created this flow:

![Passthrough flow](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/passthrough-flow.png)

We use the Webhook component in order to send data to the Petstore component.

![Webhook step](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/webhook_step.png)

Paste the following `JSON` in the input field:

```
{
"petname": "Gromit",
"petstatus": "sold",
"email": "boss.mail@mail.com"
}
```

Then we have to configure Petstore input using data from Webhook component:

![Petstore step](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/petstore_step.png)

Finaly we move on to the E-Mail component where we need to use the passthrough function. While configuring E-Mail component input we must fill in the "To" field using data from the Webhook component. At this moment we use the passthrough that allows us to use data not only from the previous, but also from earlier steps (Webhook in our case):

![E-mail step](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/email_step.png)

## Real-life Example

In this use case, we want to transfer Amazon MWS Orders into Salesforce Orders.
We aim to have all information about the orders found in Amazon MWS synchronized in
the Salesforce.

This case is interesting since Amazon MWS API gives answers in some certain ways:

*   When we query the list of orders (`listOrders`) from Amazon MWS we get information about orders such as IDs, the total amount of orders, shipping information, etc. But this answer does not include information about specific items included in those orders (`listOrderItems`).
*   To get items (`listOrderItems`) we need to store the order IDs and then use them to query the items belonging to those orders.
*   Then we need to combine both: orders (`listOrders`) and items (`listOrderItems`) together to store this information into Salesforce. But, without having the order IDs, we can not get item IDs.

We can address the above-presented scenario in two ways:
1.  We use mutliple flows (the sequential mechanism) and external ID to pass the information gradually or
2.  Use the passthrough feature to merge all the information on-the-fly.

### Sequential mechanism

In the imaginary unlucky case when we didn't have passthrough, we would have to
create a second flow for second query. There may be problems of synchronization
between the two flows, which we can try to solve with rebounds. The system tries to
get the external IDs of those orders before asking for items. If the IDs are still
not there it will try again later and later. However, there is always a limit on
how many times the system can try and that many connections can fail if one end
of integration reports a timeout.

**We need a solution which would not fail and would do it in one go!**
Solution to this dilemma is provided by the passthrough feature.

### Using the passthrough

Using the passthrough features we can get the `listOrders` and `listOrderItems` in two
separate steps. Let's take a look at our flow:

![Passthrough flow](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough_flow.gif)

**Step 1** gets a list of orders:

![Step 1: Get list of orders](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough-flow-step1.png)

**Step 2** splits the list by order:

![Step 2: Split the list by order](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough-flow-step2.png)

**Step 3** gets items in the orders:

![Step 3: Get items in the orders](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough-flow-step3.png)

**Step 4** retrieves orders from Step 2 via passthrough by update date:

![Step 4: Retrieves orders from Step 2](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough-flow-step4.png)

**Step 5** retrieves order items from Step 3 via passthrough, adding data on
scheduled delivery date, shipping date, item price and quantity of ordered items:

![Step 5: Retrieves order items from Step 3](/assets/img/getting-started/passthrough/Passthrough-flow-step5.png)

**In summary**: Instead of separating order and item handling to a second flow, we
reduce the complexity by using the passthrough feature of the platform.
