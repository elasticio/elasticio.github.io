## Recipes Overview

The Recipes feature allows users to leverage integration Flow templates for easy sharing and reusability. This document provides a comprehensive overview of Recipes, including their creation and usage. A Recipe serves as a blueprint for an integration Flow, enabling users to share popular flow patterns while keeping the underlying details hidden. These Recipes are conveniently available in a Recipe store, accessible to users based on their visibility settings. The visibility level of a Recipe is determined by its author and can be set to Workspace, Contract, Tenant, or Global. These values define the scope within which a Recipe is shared. Setting the visibility level requires corresponding permissions.

## Managing recipes

### Create recipes

Recipes can be created from existing integration Flows. Recipe contains all the necessary information for other users to recreate the same Flow, except for the non-shareable data. Users can activate a Recipe and easily recreate the desired Flow with their own configurations.

### Activate recipes

Another convenient feature is the ability to use pre-existing recipes and activate them with ease. By leveraging these already created recipes, you can quickly set up flows based on their predefined configurations.

### Embedded Recipe

We understand that in certain scenarios, end users may prefer not to directly manage the elastic.io platform. To accommodate such cases, we have a feature that allows you to provide a direct link to a Recipe page for end users. This enables them to authenticate and activate recipes without needing to navigate the entire platform.

### Embedded Recipe deployment

In situations where end users prefer not to directly manage the platform, we offer a feature that allows you to provide a direct link to a Recipe Deployment. This enables end users to update credentials used in the deployment and restart flows without the need for extensive platform management.
