An integration component is a small application specialized on
retrieving/storing objects from/to a service such as Salesforce, Quickbooks,
SAP, etc. In most cases a component connects to the service's API
(REST, SOAP, etc) on user's behalf using the provided [credentials](credential).
A component may also connect to a Database, an SFTP server, etc. to retrieve
or store data.

A component can expose multiple operations to be used in [integration flows](integration-flow).
As a rule of thumb a component talking to an application through its REST
API will expose operations that reflect the endpoints of that API. Let's
explore the integration component for the [Petstore]({{site.data.tenant.petStoreDocs}})
as an example. The following screenshot demonstrates an extract from the
Petstore API documentation.

Now if a developer would implement a Petstore component he/she will typically end
up with a component as shown in the following diagram.

![Petstore Component](/assets/img/getting-started/integration-component/petstore-component-diagram.png "Petstore Component")

The **diagram above** demonstrates a Petstore component consisting of 5 operations.
The 3 operations in blue boxes are called `triggers` and the 2 operations
in green boxes are called `actions`. Please note that the color of the
operations in the  diagram above reflect the color of the resources in
the screenshot showing Petstore API documentation.

## Trigger

A `trigger` is used to start an [integration flow](integration-flow)
by exporting data for processing. For that purpose a trigger is monitoring
changes in the source application, e.g. by sending requests to the particular API.
Once changes has been detected the trigger starts the integration flow.
As a rule of thumb any `GET` resource in a REST API is implemented as `trigger`
in an integration component.

## Action

An `action` is used to consume data produced by a `trigger` or another action.
Typically an action inserts objects into target application. That's why
any writing resource (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.) in a REST API will be implemented
as `actions` in an integration component. For example the
`Add a new pet to the store` is an action as the corresponding
resource in the Petstore API is accessible through `POST` method.

>**Please note** that a component developer is not required to cover 100% of the API in his/her component. Typically a developer would implement only those API resources that are required in the current integration project. Indeed the coverage of the APIs in the built-in {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform components varies from component to component.

## Understanding component's interaction

An component acts as a black box: its internals are hidden to an integrator.
The component exposes the following details only:

* **How to authenticate**: what data does the component require in order
to operate on integrator's behalf. Please read the details on [credentials](credential).
* **Consumed input**: In order to operate properly a component needs
some input data.
* **Produced output**: For each incoming message a component typically produces
an output message.

The following diagram shows the `Add a new pet to the store` operation from
the Petstore component.

![Create Pet](/assets/img/getting-started/integration-component/petstore-create-pet.png "Create Pet")

As you can see in the diagram above the `Add a new pet to the store` operation
requires the `Pet` interface and provides a `PetCreationResponse` interface.
In other words, the operation consumes a `Pet` object and generates a
`PetCreationResponse` object.

Now that we discussed component's interfaces let's see how components can
interact with each other using their interfaces. The following diagram
illustrates an interaction of two components.

![Component Interface Interaction](/assets/img/getting-started/integration-component/component-interface-interaction.png "Component Interface Interaction")

In the diagram above you can see an interaction between two components:
`Webhook` and `Petstore`. The `Webhook` component provides a `Payload`
interfaces and the `Petstore` component requires a `Pet` interface. How
do these two component interact with each other? This is where the `Mapper`
comes into play. The `Mapper` is responsible to transform an object into
another one with a given set of transformation rules. In the example above
the Mapper transforms a `Payload` object into a `Pet` object before it is
being passed to `Petstore` component. Mode details on Mapper can be found
[here](/guides/mapping-data).

## Implementing own integration components

The {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform provides a set of built-in components
to be used right away. Furthermore the platform is open for contributions
of custom components. Please read how to build integration components using
[Node.js](/guides/building-nodejs-component) or
[Java programming](/guides/building-java-component) languages.

## Managing components with API calls

You can create component repositories, update and delete components, get all information related to them and much more using corresponding API calls. In the process of using the components, there are often situations where you will find it easier, and sometimes necessary, to use functions that API endpoints provides. For this reason, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with all call options, which are presented in detail in the [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/components).
