This document provides basic information on Platform [resource quota](#quota) and how the [limit is calculated](#quota-limit-calculation).

## Quota
A quota defines the limit of usable resources in your Contract, Workspace or Flow. It was designed to allow the user to maintain a better resource balance, and minimize the possibility of failure due to overuse. The resources that you can limit are RAM and CPU.

Quotas can be set per Contract, per Workspace and per Flow, depending on the requirements. If a quota is enabled, but not defined, a default value in  will be set. To set a quota, a user needs a corresponding Service Account.

Note, that you can set the Workspace quota higher than Contract quota, but there is no practical sense in doing so. Workspace quota will just become redundant.

You can see the actual resource usage on the dedicated page. The usage is shown per Contract, per Workspace and per Flow. Also, you don't really need to keep an eye on the usage page all the time, because the quota service will notify you via email on different steps of approach to the limit.

As seen on the page above, only approximately 1% of the memory quota has been used this month. If you click **View Report**, you will see a resource usage chart and quota usage per each Workspace you have, and by clicking on the Workspace from the list, you can see quota usage per Flow:

## Quota Limit Calculation
A quota limit is the amount of resources multiplied by time. So if we have `2GB` quota and we want to know our monthly quota limit in `Mb*s` (a composite unit of memory usage that means 1 Megabyte of data transfer sustained for 1 second), we have to:

1\. Take `2GB` and convert them into `Mb`, so `2*1024=2048`

2\. Multiply our quota by the amount of seconds in a month (60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour, 24 hours per day, 31 days per month), `2048*60*60*24*31=5485363200`      

3\. Our quota limit is `5485363200 Mb*s`. This is, basically, how many seconds of 1 Mb data processing/transfer you get.
