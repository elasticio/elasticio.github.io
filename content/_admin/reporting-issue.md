When you send an e-mail a support ticket will be opened on your behalf and an
automated reply would give you the ticket number which you can track by registering
in our support portal. The support portal credentials are not the same as your
credentials while logged into the platform. If this is the first time submitting
an issue a new account will be created for you automatically. If you have
submitted an issue before you already have an account - [login here](https://support.elastic.io/support/login).

To help you and us get to the bottom of the issue as quickly as possible we ask
you to describe your issue in as much detail as possible. If you don't know where
to start, we compiled a list for you to go through before submitting the e-mail.
