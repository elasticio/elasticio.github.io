## Platform Sailor

Sailor is a tool that provides developers with a set of pre-built functionalities in library form, allowing them to easily create integration components for the {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform. It enables developers to interact with the platform by:

* emit messages - send them from the component further into the flow
* write logs
* manage the load - [flow control](/guides/flow-control)
* [create some hooks](/references/sailor-hooks) - code that will be executed once, for example, at startup flow

Sailor also takes care of platform interactions under the hood, including message encryption, queuing, and other tasks, making it easier for developers to focus on building their integrations.

The following tables shows the support of the platform features in Sailor versions:

 * [Node.js Sailor compatibility matrix](#nodejs-sailor-compatibility-matrix)
 * [Java Sailor compatibility matrix](#java-sailor-compatibility-matrix)

{{site.data.tenant.name}} follows the [Semver semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
for the Sailor releases. To keep the compatibility matrix manageable,
we might skip patch releases here.

## Node.js - package.json

All the available `Node.js` Sailor versions can be retrieved directly from the
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticio-sailor-nodejs) or by executing the
following command on your terminal:

```sh
npm view elasticio-sailor-nodejs versions
```

If your component is written in Node.js then you must make the modification in
your `package.json` configuration file found in the root directory of your component.
Here is where to pay particular attention:

```js
"dependencies": {
    "elasticio-sailor-nodejs": "2.7.1",
    "elasticio-node": "0.0.9",
}
```

## Java - build.gradle

All the available Java Sailor versions can be retrieved from the
[Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cio.elastic).

If your component is written in Java you must make the modification in your
`build.gradle` configuration file found in the root directory of your component.
Here is where to pay particular attention:

```java
dependencies {
    compile "io.elastic:java-api:2.1.0"
}
```
