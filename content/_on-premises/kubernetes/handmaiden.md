description: Service that ensures that Kubernetes cluster properly handles https traffic for all domains in all Tenants, and uses proper certificates for domains.

{: .no_toc}

{{page.description}} It periodically asks the [API](/on-premises/kubernetes/api)
for Tenants and their respective certificates. Also, it creates/updates/removes
ingresses and secrets with certificates for those ingresses in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Downtime
{: .d-inline-block }
not critical
{: .label .label-yellow}

Downtime will be visible only in case Tenant configuration would be changed
(e.g. new Tenant, Tenant URIâ€™s edited, Tenant certificates changes). Generally
service may be stopped for and arbitrary period of time if there is no changes
in Tenants and Tenant certificates.

## Scaling

Theoretically, it can be scaled to more then one instance. However, there is no
practical sense to do so, and it was never tested.

## Deployment

Use rolling release. Delete pod and create new.


## Strong dependencies

Service depend on Kubernetes API service to start.

## Weak dependencies

Handmaiden would not function without the following services:

*   [API](/on-premises/kubernetes/api)
*   [NGINX-ingress-controller](/on-premises/kubernetes/nginx-ingress-controller) (no ingress controller means no real work).
