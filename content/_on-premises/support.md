## Support Levels

We define 3 levels of support and support involvement Level 1, 2 and 3.

### Level 1

Level 1 support means, the users are getting immediate support directly from
the people they contacted for help. Support agents on the 1st Level try to
identify the problem and sort obvious problem causes out, for example issues like
internet connectivity or credentials/login access problems.

In case support agent during conversation can't identify and solve the customer
problem he/she will try to gather as much information as possible proceeding
with problem solving on the 2nd Level.

### Level 2

Level 2 support works partially in asynchronous mode where more detailed
problem analysis and investigation is required. Level 2 support works on prepared
information from the conversation with the 1st Level such as detailed problem
description, expected behaviour, actual behaviour etc. Level 2 support will try
to reproduce the customer problem (if possible) and find a suitable solution.

Additional conversation with the customer could be required and initiated by
the 2nd Level support agent.

### Level 3

Level 3 - unless problem could be solved on the previous levels, on the 3rd
level engineering teams are involved. It's essential that problem could be reproduced
by the Level 2 support so that engineers can work on the problem solution and test
the hot-fix (if necessary).

## Handover Criteria

Usually elastic.io takes over 2nd Level support, for the 2nd Level to effectively
help the customer following information needed to be collected by the 1st Level:

The document in elastic.io reporing issues page [gives the details](/admin/reporting-issue.html#what-information-to-send).

*   **Your contract ID, workspace ID** and the flow ID - We need this to start our investigation.
*   **When did it happen?** - We would need this information to locate the events on our back-end.
*   **Description including logs and screenshots** - Describe in as much detail as possible including the logs and screenshots.
*   **Steps to reproduce if you can** - This would greatly help us to replicate the issue and provide the solution or a workaround for a time being.
*   **Is this a blocker for you right now?** - Explain how it blocks your work.
*   **Priority: how soon you need solution?** - What would be the latest acceptable time for you?
