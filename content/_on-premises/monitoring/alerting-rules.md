{{page.description}}

As we don't dictate you an alerting solution, we provide rules and descriptions.
We recommend using them as a base for your alerts. Ask <a href="mailto:{{site.data.tenant.supportEmail}}?subject=Question about {{page.title}} article">support</a> for a rules file.

Check that metrics mentioned in rules are really collected before deploying them.
