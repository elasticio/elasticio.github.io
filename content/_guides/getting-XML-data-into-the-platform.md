## Description

There are multiple ways you could process externally-stored XML data, here we
will describe some common patterns on getting XML data into your integration flow.

## Accepting XML payload over HTTP

You can send an XML Payload over HTTP and it will be accepted by the
[WebHook component](/components/webhook/). You can do this in two ways:

*   [Send the XML in the body of the POST](#http-post-with-xml-as-a-body), or
*   [Send the XML as an attachment](#http-post-with-xml-file-as-attachment) to the POST.

## HTTP Post with XML as a Body

You can send your XML document as a Body via HTTP Post. Your HTTP request must
have the following properties:

*   HTTP Request method should be `POST`,
*   Content type of your request should be `application/xml`,
*   Body of your HTTP request should only include your XML content,
*   Whole HTTP POST with the header must not be bigger than 10MB, otherwise it will be rejected.

Here how you can post your XML data using curl

```xml
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
  -d '<foo>Hello XML!</foo>' \
  https://in.platform.address/hooks/your-hook
```

In this case, your XML document will be parsed and transformed into JSON document
automatically ([learn how to prevent automatic parsing](#i-want-to-prevent-body-transformation)).
Resulting JSON Document will be used as placed in a body of your message and message
will be sent to the next component in the flow. Here is how such message will look like:

```js
{
  "id": "2b90def0-d250-11e6-a2f1-5b2841bfd572",
  "attachments": {},
  "body": {
    "foo": "Hello XML!"
  },
  "headers": {
    "x-real-ip": "10.0.5.31, 10.0.5.31",
    "host": "in.platform.address",
    "x-forwarded-for": "10.0.5.31",
    "x-nginx-proxy": "true",
    "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
    "connection": "upgrade",
    "content-length": "21",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.51.0",
    "accept": "*/*",
    "content-type": "application/xml"
  }
}
```

> **NOTE:** your XML payload will be automatically parsed and transformed to JSON
> and if it is an invalid XML document the platform will return `HTTP 400 "Bad Request"`
> error (e.g. close tag is missing).

### I want to prevent body transformation

In case you want avoid body transformation to JSON, use `raw` query parameter
(`?raw=true`) like below:

```xml
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
  -d '<foo>Hello XML!</foo>' \
  https://in.platform.address/hooks/your-hook?raw=true
```

This works for any payload, including XML.

## HTTP Post with XML file as attachment

If you don't like how XML is parsed and represented as JSON object or you would
like to preserve your XML file for further processing, then you can send your
XML file in attachment - using `multipart/form-data` content type, so your HTTP
request must have the following properties:

*   Method must be `POST`,
*   Content type must be `multipart/form-data`,
*   We highly recommend to have the attached file content type as `application/xml`,
*   Whole HTTP POST with the header and the attachment must not be bigger than 10MB, [otherwise it will be rejected](/references/attachments-limitations).

After receiving such HTTP request WebHook component will upload your file to the
platform attachments storage and place a reference to it inside the attachments
part of the generate message:

```js
{
  "id": "2b90def0-d250-11e6-a2f1-6b2841bfd574",
  "attachments": {
    "data.xml" : {
      "url": "http://attachment_storage_URL/files/1cfc3a71-d7a7-44e6-a15e-ae18860d537c",
      "content-type": "application/xml"
    }
  },
  "body": {
  },
  "headers": {
    "x-real-ip": "10.0.5.31, 10.0.5.31",
    "host": "in.platform.address",
    "x-forwarded-for": "10.0.5.31",
    "x-nginx-proxy": "true",
    "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
    "connection": "upgrade",
    "content-length": "21",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.51.0",
    "accept": "*/*",
    "content-type": "application/xml"
  }
}
```

> **NOTE:** The platform will not parse your XML file. It will be
> temporarily stored for the next steps in the integration flow to pick and process
> this file. It is the responsibility of the following components to handle
> parsing/validation/transformation later.

## Reading XML files from external location

You can read XML files from the external location, e.g. URI or FTP or any other
file storage service. For example, you can take the SFTP component, every file
SFTP component will find on your server will be sent as an attachment, similar
to the sample above. If you would like to parse the attachments.
