## Introduction

In this document you can find the most common errors in samples and how to solve them. Understanding how you can fix these errors is extremely important for building an integration flow, since without the correct samples you can't save a step to move on to the next step.

## Credentials error

Some errors in samples appear due to the fact that credentials are invalid. In order to avoid such errors, we advise you to use the credentials verification function. You can save credentials without going through the verification stage, but in the future this can only cause additional errors. We highly recommend you to not ignore the verification function.

Here you can see how verification helps you to detect errors related to credentials in advance:

As you can see verification has failed. This happened due to the wrong **"Seller ID"**, however, you can only see information about the specific reason why the platform cannot verify credentials in the [logs](/getting-started/logs-page):

If you can correct the error, do it and repeat the verification. If everything is done correctly, the credentials will be verified:

> Please note that not all errors can be fixed directly, for example, your credentials may be outdated. It also happens that third-party server can only accept connection from white-listed IP addresses. These errors cannot be seen in the [logs](/getting-started/logs-page).

## Getaway Timeout error

One of the most common causes of a sample error is "Getaway Timeout" error. An error occurs if the third-party server did not respond during your request - the default timeout is 1 minute:

Below we will consider the reasons why such an error may appear and how to fix it.

### Invalid request

In this example, we will look at the [Rest API component](/components/rest-api) input. We perform API call using this URL which will give us access to information about green energy in our city. The city is identified by the Postal code at the end of the URL:

![Rest API input](/assets/img/integrator-guide/sample-errors/postal-code.png)

In our case, the postal code is invalid. Because of this, we were unable to get a response from the site. To fix this you should first check your request for an error. If everything is correct, then the external source may no longer have the data that you are requesting.

### White listing

Another reason for the "Getaway Timeout" error is that third-party server can only accept connection from white-listed IP-addresses. Please contact support to get the external IP addres of the platform so that you can white-list it on your side.
