- `GLOBAL.RECIPE.GET` - allows seeing all recipes regardless of their [visibility](creating-recipes#visibility) level. E.g. if you have this permission in tenant #1, you will see all recipes in tenant #1 even if their visibility is Workspace.
- `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.SYNC` - allows syncing Recipe Deployments depending on the scope of this permission (Global or Tenant).
- `GLOBAL.RECIPE_DEPLOYMENT.GET` - allows seeing all Recipe Deployments even if youâ€™re not a member of the workspace to which they relate.
- `GLOBAL.RECIPE.EDIT_VISIBILITY_GLOBAL` - allows setting Recipe visibility level to Global.
- `TENANT.RECIPE.EDIT_VISIBILITY_TENANT` - allows setting Recipe visibility level to Tenant.
- `WORKSPACE.FLOW.EXPORT_TO_RECIPE` - allows creating a Recipe from the set of flows.
- `WORKSPACE.RECIPE.EDIT` - allows creating/editing/deleting a Recipe and setting its visibility to Contract or Workspace.
- `WORKSPACE.FLOW.EDIT` - allows syncing Recipe Deployments in the workspace.
