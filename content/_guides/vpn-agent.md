This document provides basic information on [VPN Agent](#vpn-agent), [how to set it up](#how-to-setup)
and [use it in your integration flow](#using-vpn-agent).

## VPN Agent

The VPN Agent or the Agent is Ð° VPN tunnel specifically configured to access any
local resource in your local environment. It could be any local database or CRM
to which you would rather restrict access from outside world but still need
to query for a data.

When the Agent is configured the platform and your local resource communicate data
using the secure VPN tunnel. All the processing is happening on platform side, your
resource serves the role of data source or final destination of data depending on
your use case.

> Please note that you can manage VPN agents using API calls. You can find all the information you need about it [here]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/vpn%20agents).

## How to setup

To setup the Agent you would need to fulfill the following preconditions:

*   **You have a running local resource which has a local IP address and port.** The IP address should not be `127.0.0.1` or instead be `localhost`. Please consult the documentation of your resource on how to configure it.
*   **Working VPN client which accepts OpenVPN configurations.**
*   Optionally: Administrative rights to configure the local network on your host machine in case you have non-standard setup.

> Please note that below, you will find a dedicated section specifically for the Windows operating system (OS) family. This section comprehensively covers all the essential details pertaining to setting up the VPN Agent on [Windows OS](#vpn-agent---windows-os-family).

### Connecting to local database

As an example let us connect the locally running Mongo database with the platform.
Let's assume our local database is accessible on `192.168.1.7` address and `27017`
port (standard MongoDB port).

Navigate to left-hand-side menu, Integrate > Agents and press on **Create an Agent** button
if you don't have any Agents or press on **Create New Agent** button to add new one. You can also create a VPN agent using this [API endpoint]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/vpn%20agents/post_agents_vpn).

You will get a new pop-up form to fill in the details. Note you can extend the form
by selecting **Create New Endpoint**.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/getting-started/vpn-agent/vpn-agent-form-empty.png" title="VPN Agent request form" %}

Let us fill in the needed values:

1.  Give a proper name to remember what is it for. We will use `MongoDB_local_com`.
2.  Select from drop-down menu the connection protocol type `TCP` or `UDP`. We use `TCP` because we use MongoDB and it uses TCP protocol.
3.  Enter the IP address and the port. In our case we will add `192.168.1.7` and `27017`.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/getting-started/vpn-agent/vpn-agent-form-filled.png" title="VPN Agent request form filled" %}

Click **Save** to save all entry values and submit to the system. After this the
form will disappear and a new record appear in the page. Click on newly created
record to see the details.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/getting-started/vpn-agent/vpn-agent-form-final.png" title="VPN Agent configuration details" %}

Before going further save the address in Endpoint configuration to use in the
credential configuration stage. In our case it is `bloody-gate-service.platform:1046`.
In your case you will get the same service with different port number (`bloody-gate-service.platform:XXXX`).

Press **Download Configuration** to get configured OpenVPN configuration file
`*.ovpn` which you must install in your local VPN client and start it.

Congratulations, you have established a secure VPN tunnel between your local
resource and the platform. Now time to use this in your integration flow configuration.

## VPN Agent - Windows OS Family

This documentation provides instructions for setting up the VPN Agent on the Windows OS family, including Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows 7 Professional. While the steps mentioned here have been tested on specific versions, they should generally work on older versions as well. Please note that no manual testing has been conducted on the older versions.

Before you begin the installation process, ensure that you have administrator privileges on the machine. Commands executed in the command prompt (`cmd`) or PowerShell should be run with administrator privileges. The easiest way to do this is by starting the shell as an administrator by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator."

### Common Part

1. Install and run the OpenVPN client with the appropriate configuration.

2. The installation process will create a new network connection. You can find this connection's name (`tunnel interface`), IP address (`tunnel IP address`), network, and netmask (`tunnel net` in CIDR format, e.g., 172.19.0.0/16) by referring to the Control Panel, using the `ipconfig` command in the command prompt, or using the `Get-NetIPInterface` command in PowerShell.

3. Identify the network connection that will be used to connect to your remote system (`typically Ethernet`) (`outgoing interface`). Make a note of its IP address (`outgoing IP address`).

<details close markdown="block"><summary><strong>Windows Server 2019</strong></summary>

**1.** SEnable IP routing by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```
Set-NetIPInterface -Forwarding Enabled
```

To check if IP routing is enabled, run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Get-NetIPInterface | Select-Object ifIndex, InterfaceAlias, AddressFamily, ConnectionState, Forwarding | Sort-Object -Property IfIndex | Format-Table
```

**2.** Enable NAT by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```
New-NetNat -Name NAT_NAME -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix <tunnel net>
```
Replace `<tunnel net>` with the appropriate value for the tunnel network. To check if NAT was created successfully, run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Get-NetNat
```

**3.** Grant access through the firewall by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow Inbound from Tunnel" -Direction Inbound -RemoteAddress <tunnel net>, <outgoing IP address> -Action Allow
```

Replace `<tunnel net>` with the tunnel network and `<outgoing IP address>` with the outgoing IP address. You can also use the `Windows Firewall` UI or disable the firewall entirely in the `Control Panel`. However, disabling the firewall poses security risks. To check if the rule was installed successfully, you can use the `Windows Firewall` UI or run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Get-NetFirewallRule
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary><strong>Windows Server 2012 R2</strong></summary>

**1.** Enable IP routing by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```
Set-NetIPInterface -Forwarding Enabled
```

To check if IP routing is enabled, run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Get-NetIPInterface | Select-Object ifIndex, InterfaceAlias, AddressFamily, ConnectionState, Forwarding | Sort-Object -Property IfIndex | Format-Table
```

**2.** Enable NAT:

Setting up NAT in Windows Server 2012 R2 is more involved compared to Windows Server 2019. Please refer to the [documentation](https://www.itprotoday.com/windows-server/jsi-tip-7353-how-do-i-configure-nat-server-windows-server-2003) for detailed instructions. This involves installing and configuring the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) using the UI. Add the `tunnel interface` as Private and the `outgoing interface` as Public. You can install and enable RRAS using the following PowerShell command:

```
Install-WindowsFeature Routing -IncludeManagementTools
```

**3.** Grant access through the firewall by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:

```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow Inbound from Tunnel" -Direction Inbound -RemoteAddress <tunnel net>, <outgoing IP address> -Action Allow
```

Replace `<tunnel net>` with the tunnel network and `<outgoing IP address>` with the outgoing IP address. You can also use the `Windows Firewall` UI or disable the firewall entirely in the `Control Panel`. However, disabling the firewall poses security risks. To check if the rule was installed successfully, you can use the `Windows Firewall` UI or run the following command in PowerShell:

```
Get-NetFirewallRule
```

</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary><strong>Windows 7</strong></summary>

**1.** Enable Routing and Remote Service (RRAS): Go to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services -> Routing and Remote Access. Set the startup mode to "Automatic," apply the changes, and start the service.

**2.** Instead of enabling NAT, configure Internet Connection Sharing (ICS):

* Go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center.
* Click on "Change adapter settings."
* Right-click on the `outgoing interface` and select "Properties."
* In the "Properties" window, navigate to the "Sharing" tab.
* Enable the checkbox "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection."
* Select the `tunnel interface` under "Home networking connection."

> Notice: It might be necessary to disconnect and reconnect the OpenVPN client after making this setting change.

**3.** Grant access through the firewall:

* Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Firewall -> Advanced Settings -> New Rule.
* Create an "Inbound" rule that allows all traffic for all programs, protocols, and ports where remote IP addresses are from the `tunnel net` (e.g., 172.19.0.0/16).
* Alternatively, you can disable the firewall entirely by going to Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Firewall -> Turn Windows Firewall on or off. However, disabling the firewall poses security risks.

> Please keep in mind the security implications when modifying firewall settings.

## Using VPN Agent

Since we have used MongoDB for our example we will use the [MongoDB component](/components/mongodb)
in the configuration of our integration flow. We will jump directly to the step
configuration to show how to use the Agent.

{% include img.html max-width="60%" url="/assets/img/getting-started/vpn-agent/vpn-agent-credential.png" title="VPN Agent configuring the credentials" %}

Picture above shows the filled form for MongoDB credentials in the step configuration
where couple of details should be considered:

1.  Use Drop-down menu **Choose Agent** to select the Agent. Our new agent called `MongoDB_local_conn` is online as indicative of the green dot beside the name.
2.  Give an informative name to your credential.
3.  Make sure to enter the correct URL address like we do `mongodb://bloody-gate-service.platform:1046`. **You must not use the connection URL available on your local environment**. The VPN gateway will take care of port forwarding for you.
4.  Use the same `username/password` pair as you would use locally.
5.  Enter the Authentication Database as you would do locally to login.

And lastly **Verify** and **Save** your credential.

Congratulations, you are now ready to query your local database and use the results
to process further.

>You can always update your agent, get all the information you need about it, or just delete it using the appropriate **API endpoints**.
All the necessary information about this you can find in our [API documentation]({{site.data.tenant.apiDocsUri}}/v2#/vpn%20agents).
