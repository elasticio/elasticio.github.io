select as a first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

### String To Attachment

Creates attachment from input `value`. Output is `attachmentId` in `message.body` and attachment object in `message.attachments`.

#### Configuration fields description

* `encodeToBase64` - if checked encode an input `value` using Base64 encode. Than saves encoded value into attachment.

### String From Attachment

Creates string from attachment with provided input `attachmentId`.

#### Configuration fields description

* `decodeFromBase64` - if checked decode attachment content using Base64 decode before output. If content of attachment is malformed or not Base64 encoded string, result will be malformed.  

### Base64 Decode

Decodes input `value` using Base64 decoding to regular string. If malformed input provided or not Base64 encoded string, result will be malformed.

### Base64 Encode

Encodes input `value` using Base64 encoding.

## Limitations

1. Maximal possible size for an attachment is 10 MB.
2. Attachments mechanism does not work with Local Agent Installation
