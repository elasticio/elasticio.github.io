## Known limitations

1. `Configured Request` action does not support ENUM inputs.
2. Only arguments may be used in `Configured Request` action (selection of `fields` is not available yet and all available fields would be returned in response)
3. Configuration of `Response structure max depth` feauture in `Configured Request` action would not affect on actual result: all available fields would be returned with max available depth.
