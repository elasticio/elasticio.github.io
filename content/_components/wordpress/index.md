## Description

The Wordpress Component facilitates interaction with the [Wordpress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/).

## Credentials

To use this component, you need to authenticate against your WordPress site using Basic Authentication with an [Application Password](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/#basic-authentication-with-application-passwords). Follow these steps to obtain the required credentials:

1. Log in to your WordPress Admin Dashboard.

2. Go to `Users` â†’ `Profile` (or your user account).

3. Scroll down to the `Application Passwords` section.

4. Enter a name and click `Add New Application Password`.

5. Copy the generated password immediately â€” you wonâ€™t see it again.

ðŸ’¡ Note: You must have at least WordPress 5.6 and HTTPS enabled. Application passwords only work for users with the `edit_posts` capability.

Use the following fields to configure your credentials in the component:

* **Base URL** (string, required) - The base URL of your WordPress site, e.g., `https://example.com`.
* **Username** (string, required) - The username of the WordPress account you generated the application password for.
* **Application Password** (string, required) - The application password generated in Step 5.
