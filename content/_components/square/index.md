## Description

The Square Component is designed to facilitate interaction with the [Square API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square).

This component has been tested with API version `2024-06-04`.

## Credentials

To use this component, you will need to [obtain a personal access token](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens#get-a-personal-access-token).

Component credentials configuration fields:

- **Access token** (string, required): Provide your `Sandbox` or `Production` access token here.
- **Environment** (dropdown, required): Select the desired environment.
- **Square Version** (string, optional): Specify the version here. If left blank, the component will default to `2024-06-04`.

## Triggers

### Webhook

Creates a [subscription](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/webhooks/webhook-subscriptions-api) in Square for selected events and receives them.

### Configuration Fields

- **Events** - (multiselect dropdown, required): Select the events to subscribe to.
- **Name of the Webhook** - (string, optional): Specify a name for your webhook. This can help you identify it in the Square UI. If not provided, the name will default to "Flow {flow_id}".
- **API version** - (string, required): The Square API version that will be used to send events to the component. If left blank, the component will use the version specified in the credentials or default to `2024-06-04`.

#### Input Metadata

None

#### Output Metadata
The selected event from the subscription.

#### Limitations
- If you use an ordinary flow ([`real-time`](/guides/realtime-flows.html) not enabled), after the flow starts, you will need to run it once. Just follow the webhook URL (to trigger the first execution). This action will create a subscription.

## Actions
