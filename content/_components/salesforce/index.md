> **Please Note**: The component works with the Salesforce API. This means you must
> make sure your Salesforce edition has API Access enabled. To check which editions
> have API access see the [Salesforce editions with API Access](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000326486&type=1&mode=1) document.
> **If your edition has no API Access by default this component _will not work for you_.**

### Technical Notes

The [technical notes](technical-notes) page gives some technical details about
Salesforce component like [changelog](technical-notes#changelog) and the
[completeness matrix](technical-notes#completeness-matrix).

## Credentials

Authentication occurs via OAuth 2.0.

In order to make OAuth work, you need a new App in your Salesforce. During app
creation process you will be asked to specify the callback URL, to process OAuth
authentication via elastic.io platform your callback URL should be `{{site.data.tenant.appURL}}/callback/oauth2`.

More information you can find [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=connected_app_create.htm).

### Credentials creation

During credentials creation you would need to:

*  select existing Auth-Client from drop-down list ``Choose Auth Client`` or create the new one.

![Add new client](img/add-new-client.png)

For creating Auth Client you should specify following fields:

![Define client](img/define-client.png)

| Field name             | Mandatory | Description      |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Name                   | true      | your Auth Client's name    |
| Client ID              | true      | your OAuth client key      |
| Client Secret          | true      | your OAuth client secret   |
| Authorization Endpoint | true      | your OAuth authorization endpoint. For production use `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize`, for sandbox - `https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize` |
| Token Endpoint         | true      | your OAuth Token endpoint for refreshing access token. For production use `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`, for sandbox - `https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` |

- fill field ``Name Your Credential``
- click on ``Authenticate`` button - if you have not logged in Salesforce before then log in by entering data in the login window that appears
- click on ``Verify`` button for verifying your credentials
- click on ``Save`` button for saving your credentials

Here you can see how to select an existing `client`:

For more information pleas read our [Creating OAuth App for Salesforce](creating-oauth-app-for-salesforce) article.

> **Please Note**: When you deploy the Salesforce component separately into a dedicated tenant or
> into your developer team it can not use the OAuth App specifically created for
> our main {{site.data.tenant.name}} tenant. For this purposes you must create a
> different OAuth App and add the required environment variables to the component setup.
