## Triggers

### Get New and Updated Objects Polling

Retrieve all the updated or created objects within a given time range.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Drive Identity** - (dropdown, required): OneDrive instance to work with
* **Folders path** - (multiselect dropdown, required): Select folders to follow
* **Include subfolders** - (checkbox, optional): If checked, trigger will follow to each subfolder of selected folder.
    >**Please Note:** this will increase the number of API calls

* **Enable File Attachments** - (checkbox, optional): If checked, the file will be uploaded to local storage and the link provided in response.
* **Timestamp field to poll on** - (dropdown, optional, default `Last Modified`): Select which date will be used to track files - `Last Modified` or `Created`
* **Emit Behavior** - (dropdown, optional, default `Emit individually`): Defines the way result objects will be emitted, one of `Emit page` or `Emit individually`.
* **Page Size** - (number, optional, defaults to 999, max 999): Indicates the size of pages to be fetched per request
* **Start Time** - (string, optional): The timestamp to start polling from (inclusive) - using ISO 8601 Date time utc format - YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ. The default value is the beginning of time (January 1, 1970, at 00:00).
* **End Time** - (string, optional): The timestamp to stop polling (exclusive) - using ISO 8601 Date time utc format - YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ. Default value is flow execution time.

#### Input Metadata

There is no Input or Output metadata in this trigger.

#### Output Metadata

Depends on `Enable File Attachments` and `Emit behavior` fields.
 * If `Emit behavior` field is equal to `Emit page` - object with property `results` that contains array of files
 * If `Emit behavior` field is equal to `Emit individually`, file information will fulfill whole message
 * If `Enable File Attachments` is checked, for each file there will be an additional field - `attachmentUrl`

#### Limitations

* OneDrive API doesn't support filtering - as result, we collect information about all files from selected folders and filter them locally (inside the component) for each trigger execution
* From the point above, option `Emit page` does not always emit records according to `Page Size`
* `Include subfolders` increase amount of API calls - additional call for each subfolder and inner folders

## Actions

#### Configuration Fields

  * **Fail** - Fails if a folder with the same name already exists under provided `path`
  * **Generate new name** -  If the folder with the same name already exists under provided `path` then will be created a new folder with a different name. Examples: `folder_name` (already exist) -> `folder_name 1` (will be created), `folder_name 1` (already exist) -> `folder_name 1 1` (will be created)
  * **Upsert** - If the folder already exists, you will get information about this folder
