## Latest changelog

**1.2.0 (September 25, 2019)**

### Actions

* Add Soap Reply action

### Triggers

* Add Receive SOAP Request trigger

> To see the full **changelog** please use the following [link](/components/soap/changelog).

## Description

The SOAP Component provides the SOAP Web Services work opportunity within a
{{site.data.tenant.name}} flow.

### Purpose

As an integration platform, {{site.data.tenant.name}} has an opportunity to
invoke SOAP Web services over HTTP.

### How it works

#### Step 1

Find and select SOAP component in the component repository:

![Step 1](img/step_1.png)

#### Step 2

Create new or select existing credentials:

![Step 2](img/step_2.png)

#### Step 3

Specify WSDL URL, then choose binding and operation consecutively. **The order matters!** Then configure an input data and click "Continue":

![Step 3](img/step_3.png)

#### Step 4

Retrieve sample or add sample manually:

![Step 4: Retrieve sample](img/step_4.png)

#### Step 5

Retrieve sample result:

![Step 5: Retrieve sample result](img/step_5.png)

### Requirements

The platform supports the following SOAP protocol versions:
*   SOAP 1.1
*   SOAP 1.2

Component supports the following WSDL styles:

*   RPC/Literal
*   Document/Encoded
*   Document/Literal

#### Environment variables

`OIH_REQUIRED_RAM_MB - recommended value of allocated memory is 2048MB `

## Credentials

### Type

You can select the following authorization type:

*   **No Auth**
*   **Basic Auth**
    *   **Username** - Username for Basic authorization header in the SOAP request
    *   **Password** - Password for Basic authorization header in the SOAP request
*   **API Key Auth** (*not supported yet*).

## Triggers

### Receive SOAP Request

Webhook that validates input body over WSDL.

#### Input fields description

*   **WSDL URI** - Public URL address of the WSDL
*   **Binding** - One of the bindings available and described in the WSDL, which you want to use for a SOAP call
*   **Operation** - One of the operations available for the binding you have selected above.
*   **Validation** - If `Enabled` validate the SOAP Body over WSDL, if `Disabled` does not validate a SOAP Input Body

#### Example of usage

##### Configuration:

*   **WSDL URI** - `http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl`
*   **Binding** - `CalculatorSoap12`
*   **Operation** - `Add`
*   **Validation** - `Enabled`

##### Request Body:

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <Add xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
      <intA>1</intA>
      <intB>1</intB>
    </Add>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

##### Output:

```json
{
  "Add": {
    "intA": "1",
    "intB": "1"
  }
}
```

#### Known Limitations

1.  Namespaces ignored and SOAP Body with 2 tags that have same name but in different namespaces would be invalid
2.  SOAP Headers not supported yet
3.  Retrieve Sample does not represent actual behaviour of component

## Actions

### Call

Makes a call to SOAP service over HTTP using public WSDL URL

#### Input fields description

*   **WSDL URI** - Public URL address of the WSDL
*   **Binding** - One of the bindings available and described in the WSDL, which you want to use for a SOAP call
*   **Operation** - One of the operations available for the binding you have selected above.

#### SOAP Fault

A SOAP fault is used to carry error information within a SOAP message. The component
handles SOAP faults and emits platform exception in this case. SOAP Fault should
comply with the [W3C SOAP Fault standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#soapfault).

#### Input json schema

The component does not have static input json schema as it is dynamically generated
for every wsdl/binding/operation specified during the configuration of the component input fields.
[Apache Axis2](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/) and [FasterXML JsonSchemaGenerator](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jsonSchema) tools are used by the component internally to generate an input metadata.
You can refer these tools documentation to get deeper understanding about the product.

#### Output json schema

Output json schema is generated dynamically the same as for the input (see above).

## Additional information

**You should specify input fields exactly in the order below. You'll get an error otherwise**.
1. WSDL URI
2. Binding
3. Operation

### Soap Reply

Wraps and returns input data as SOAP response by provided SOAP metadata

#### Input fields description

*   **WSDL URI** - Public URL address of the WSDL
*   **Binding** - One of the bindings available and described in the WSDL, which you want to use for a SOAP call
*   **Operation** - One of the operations available for the binding you have selected above.

#### Input json schema

The component does not have static input json schema as it is dynamically generated for every wsdl/binding/operation specified during the configuration of the component input fields.
[Apache Axis2](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/) and [FasterXML JsonSchemaGenerator](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jsonSchema) tools are used by the component internally to generate an input metadata.

#### Output json schema

Output json schema is generated dynamically the same as for the input (see above).

#### Input data example:

```json
{
  "AddResponse": {
    "AddResult": 3
  }
}
```

#### Output data example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <soap:Body>
        <AddResponse xmlns="http://example.org/">
            <AddResult>3</AddResult>
        </AddResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

## Current limitations

Here are the limitations of this component:

*   RPC/SOAP-Encoded styles are not supported.
    *   **All major frameworks for web services support Document/literal messages. Most of the popular frameworks also have some support for rpc/encoded, so developers can still use it to create encoded-only services.** As a result it is hard to estimate the number of web services, in production use, work only with SOAP encoded messages. However, there is a tendency to move away from RPC/encoded towards Document/literal. Since the SOAP encoding specification does not guarantee 100% inter-operability and there are vendor deviations in the implementation of RPC/encoded.
*  Only self-containing WSDLs are supported now. This means that WSDL containing external XSD schemas will not work in this version of the component.
*  WS-Security header is not supported.
*  WS-Addressing is not supported.
*  Custom SOAP headers can not be added.
*  The WSDL and associated schemas must be accessible via a publicly accessible URL. File upload of the WSDL and/or XSD schemas is not supported.
*  Component does not support multi-part format of message in the SOAP request element. Only first part of request element will be processed in the current component version.
