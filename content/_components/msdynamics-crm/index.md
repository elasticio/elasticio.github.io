## Configuration Info

### Required environment variables

`EIO_REQUIRED_RAM_MB` must be set to `512`.  This is because the metadata file for the service is large enough that it requires additional RAM to be parsed.

For the local testing (e.g. spec-integration) the following environment variables are required:
* `RESOURCE`
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `ODATA_API_ROOT_LOCATION`
* `OAUTH_TOKEN`
* `CONTACT_TO_LOOKUP_FIRST_NAME`
* `CONTACT_TO_LOOKUP_TOO_MANY_LAST_NAME`
