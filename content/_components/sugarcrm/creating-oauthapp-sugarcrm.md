This step is necessary to platform to your SugarCRM instance. This is one of the steps in
the [authentication process of SugarCRM component](index#authentication).

## Purpose

To connect the platform to your SugarCRM instance, an app needs to be created on
that instance. Below are the steps to do so. Once that is done, you will provide
a valid username and password to the {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform. The
platform will exchange that `username` and `password` for a token. In a production
system, the best practice is to create a dedicated user for the {{site.data.tenant.name}}
platform. This user should have the minimum required permissions.

## Steps to follow

1.  As an admin on your SugarCRM instance, go to the Administration panel
