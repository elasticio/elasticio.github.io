## How works

Under the hood used MongoDB. During Action configuration collection need to be specified.

### Purpose

Main goal of this component is to provide simple possibility to store and retrieve Key:Value pairs.

### Requirements

Instance of MongoDB with possibility to connect from component.

### Environment variables

> Please Note: From the platform version [20.51](/releases/20/51) we deprecated the
> component `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Now you can control logging level per each step of the flow.

### Technical Notes

The [technical notes](technical-notes) page gives some technical details about Simple Storage component like [changelog](/components/key-value/technical-notes#changelog) and [completeness matrix](/components/key-value/technical-notes#completeness-matrix).

## Credentials

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-credentials.png" title="Credentials" %}

  * **hostname -** Hostname or IP address of MongoDB server.

  * **port -** Port which is used by your MongoDB server to accept connection. (Default is 27017)

  * **db -** Database name that is used to store collections with Key:Values

  * **user -** MongoDB username with access to read and write from/to corresponding DB and collection.

  * **pass -** Password for specified user.

## Triggers

This component has no trigger functions. This means it will not be accessible to
select as a first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

### Store Key

Insert new or update existing Key:Value pair

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-store-key.png" title="Store Key" %}

#### Input fields:

**keyName -** Name of a field where key will be stored

**key -** Value of a key that uniquely identifies Key:Value pair

**valueName -** Name of a field where value will be stored

**value -** Value that will be stored and can be accessed with provided keyName and key

If checkbox **"Update if exists?"** checked then value would be updated if already exists.

Resulting document stored in MongoDb will have following structure:

```
{
    keyName: key,
    valueName: value
}
```

If another valueName will be stored with the same keyName:key it will be added to existing document and result will be:

```
{
    keyName: key,
    valueName: value,
    valueName1: value1
}
```

Result will be:

* If there where no such keyName:key yet:

```
{
  "response": "inserted"
}
```
* If keyName:key already exists but doesn't have valueName provided:

```
{
  "response": "updated"
}
```

 * If such keyName:key and valueName combination already exists and checkbox **"Update if exists?"** checked:

 ```
{
  "response": "updated"
}
```

* If such keyName:key and valueName combination already exists and checkbox **"Update if exists?"** not checked:

 ```
{
  "response": "skipped"
}
```

### Store Key Batch

Insert new or replace existing Key:Value pair from Batch.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-store-key-batch.png" title="Store Key Batch" %}

#### Input fields:

**keyName -** Name of a field where key will be stored

**valueName -** Name of a field where value will be stored

**keyValArray -** Array with values

Each value in array is object which have following fields:

**keyValue -** Value of a key that uniquely identifies Key:Value pair

**value -** Value that will be stored and can be accessed with provided keyName

Request example:

```
{
    keyName: "someKeyName",
    valueName: "someValueName",
    keyValArray: [
        {
            keyValue : "someKeyValue1",
            value: "someValue1"
        },
        {
            keyValue : "someKeyValue2",
            value: "someValue2"
        }
    ]
}
```

All provided Key:Vale pairs will be inserted, if key already exist it will be replaced.

Response:

```
{
  "response": "done"
}
```

### Retrieve Key

Returns value by provided key and Value name if found or provided default value.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-retrieve.png" title="Retrieve Key" %}


#### Input fields:

**keyName -** Name of a field where key is stored

**key -** Value of a key that uniquely identifies Key:Value pair

In response document from MongoDB collection will be provided, e.g.:

```
{
    keyName: keyValue,
    valueName: value,
    valueName1: value1
}
```

### Retrieve Key Batch

Returns  array of values by provided key array.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-retrieve-batch.png" title="Retrieve Key Batch" %}

#### Input fields:

**keyName -** Name of a field where key stored

**keyArray -** Array of keyValues

Response format is following:

```
{
  "response": [
    {
      keyName1: key1,
      valueName1: value1
    },
    {
        keyName2: key2,
        valueName2: value2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Remove Key

Removes Value provided in valueName or all values for specified key if **"Delete all values for this key?"** checkbox checked.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/simple-storage-remove.png" title="Remove Key" %}

#### Input fields:

**keyName -** Name of a field where key stored

**key -** Value of a key that uniquely identifies
Key:Value pair

**valueName -** Name of a field that should be deleted

Response format is following:

```
{
  "result": "done"
