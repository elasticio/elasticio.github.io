## Description

This component uses v2 version of API which described at [AppMarket API Reference](https://help.appdirect.com/api/appmarket.html)

### Authentication

Authentication occurs via OAuth 2.0. To make OAuth work, you need a new App in your Environment.

### Configuring your environment

Here is how to configure your environment:

1.  Login to your environment.
2.  Follow to **Manage --> Marketplace -->  Setting -->  API Clients --> Create API Client**
3.  Create a new API Client:
    -   Specify **Name** of client
    -   Enable **oauth2** authorization
    -   Select "**Authorization Code**" grant type checkbox
    -   Specify the **callback URL**

Your callback URL should be

```
https://your-tenant.address/callback/oauth2
```

Check that `Require API client to request scopes` option is disabled in your API Client:

![API Client Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22715422/78552759-be8ddf00-7810-11ea-8e60-498b2c4e6038.png)

Click **Save Settings**. The new API client is created, along with a Consumer
Secret and Consumer Key. A message appears that includes the Consumer Secret
and a warning that you should copy and store the secret in a safe location
because it cannot be retrieved after the message is dismissed.

You can use [Create API clients](https://help.appdirect.com/appmarket/Default.htm#MarketplaceManager/api-client-create.html) manual for additional information.

## Credentials

-   `Environment URL` - The Url of your AppDirect environment. For example `demo.example.com`.
-   `Consumer Key` - Consumer Key which you received during API client configuration step.
-   `Consumer Secret` - Consumer Secret which you received during API client configuration step.

### Creating credentials

-   Specify Environment URL (without `http://` or `https://` prefixes)
-   Specify Consumer Key
-   Specify Consumer Secret
-   Click "Authenticate"
-   Specify your **Email** and **Password** and click **"Log In"**
-   After getting a **"Success"** notification save your credentials.

## Triggers

### Webhook subscription

Webhooks are notifications that the AppDirect platform can send to Integration
Flow when certain events occur in the system. For example, you can receive
notifications when users are created, when products are modified, when
subscriptions are canceled, and so on. The AppDirect platform sends notifications
to the component in real time.

When flow starts, the component tries to create a new subscription using trigger
configuration. The component can not create a new subscription if the same
subscription already exists in AppDirect platform. Before flow stop, component
tries to remove a subscription to Webhook URL with specified in configuration
**entity type** value.

You can use [documentation](https://help.appdirect.com/appmarket/Default.htm#MarketplaceManager/mm-set-integ-webhook.htm) for more detail information.
