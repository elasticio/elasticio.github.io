## Changelog

### 1.0.0 (March 28, 2024)

The component is derived from the [code-component](/components/code/) `1.2.11`.

  A noteworthy enhancement in this version is the introduction of an authorization mechanism. This mechanism involves the use of credentials, which are available in four distinct types:
  * `No Auth`
  * `Basic Auth`
  * `API Key`
  * `OAuth 2.0`
