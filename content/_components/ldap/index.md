## Technical Notes

The [technical notes](technical-notes) page gives some technical details about Ldap component like [changelog](/components/ldap/technical-notes#changelog).

## Triggers

This component has no trigger functions. This means it will not be accessible to
select as a first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

### Search

Performs an [LDAP search operation](https://www.ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation) on the instance.

![Search](img/search.png)

* *Base* refers to the base object in the directory from which to start the search.
* *Filter* allows you to specify one or more [LDAP filters](https://www.ldap.com/ldap-filters) to restrict the results of the search.
* *Scope* refers to the [search scope](https://www.ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation).  Options are `base`,
 `one` or `sub` (sometimes called `baseObject`, `singleLevel` or `wholeSubtree`
 respectively). The `subordinates` (a.k.a. `subordinateSubtree`) scope is not
 yet supported.

Each matched result is returned individually.

## Development

This component has some integration tests.  In order to run the integration
tests, one needs to create a `.env` file which contains the following
environment variables:

```
LDAP_URL=<URL To Test Instance>
LDAPUSER=<User For Test Instance>
PASSWORD=<Password For Test Instance>
BASE=<Search Criteria which should match exactly 4 results>
```

## Configuration Info

### Required environment variables

No environment variables need to be configured.
