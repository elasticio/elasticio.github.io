#### Output Metadata

* Object with result of lookup as value.

### Lookup Objects (plural)

Lookup a set of object by defined criteria list. Can be emitted in different way.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (dropdown, required): Object-type to lookup on. E.g `Users`.
* **Emit Behavior** - (dropdown, required): Defines the way result objects will be emitted, one of `Emit all`, `Emit page` or `Emit individually`.

#### Input Metadata

* **Search Criteria** - (array of strings, required): Search terms to be combined with the AND operator, E.g: `[{ fieldName: 'createdon', operator: 'gt', fieldValue: '2022-08-28T14:27:45Z' }, { fieldName: 'name', operator: 'eq', fieldValue: '"Alex"' }]`

If selected `Emit Behavior` is `Emit page` additionally fields will be added:
* **Page Number** - (number, defaults to 0): Indicates index of page to be fetched.
