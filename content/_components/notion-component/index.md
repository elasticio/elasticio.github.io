## Description

Notion Component is designed to interact with [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro).

The current release of the component tested on API version `2022-06-28` with `https://api.notion.com/v1/` basic path.

## Credentials

To be able to connect to Notion API you will need to proceed with the following steps:

- The workspace owner needs to create [Internal integrations](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) through the [Integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
- Once an internal integration has been added to a workspace, members must [give the integration permission](https://www.notion.so/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#add-connections-to-pages) to access specific pages or databases through Notionâ€™s UI by adding a connection to the pages or databases.

Component credentials configuration fields:

- **Internal Integration Secret** (string, required) - Put here your secret from internal integration `Secrets` section.
- **API version** (string, optional, defaults to `2022-06-28`) - You can provide the needed API version here, [more information can be found here](https://developers.notion.com/reference/versioning).
