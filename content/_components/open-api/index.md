[OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

### Technical Notes

The [technical notes](technical-notes) page gives some technical details about Open API component like [changelog](/components/open-api/technical-notes#changelog) and [completeness matrix](/components/open-api/technical-notes#completeness-matrix).

### A URL to an OpenAPI/Swagger document

A URL to an OpenAPI/Swagger document that would define the calls that could be made, as example https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json

## Triggers

This component has no trigger functions. This means it will not be accessible to
select as a first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

### Make Request

![Make Request](img/make-request.png)

#### List of Expected Config fields

* Path - A dropdown for the paths than defined in the OpenAPI document.

* Operation - A dropdown for the operations that are allowed for a previously defined path.

* Do not throw Error on Failed Calls - An option as to whether or not errors should be thrown for HTTP codes in the 4xx/5xx range.

>**Please Note** an exception is the 401 HTTP status code - error would be thrown for this code regardless of field value (true/false)

#### Expected input metadata

Input metadata is depend on parameters, that are defined in [operation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/describing-parameters/):

`path parameters` are defined as a separate fields, and `body` as object that should be configured by user.

For example, path `/pet/{petId}` and operation `get` metadata is:

```json
     {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "petId": {
           "type": "integer",
           "required": true
         }
       }
     }
```

## Known limitations

 - OpenApi v2.0 is supported only
 - Multiply hosts are not supported
 - Each operation should contains only one tag
 - Authentication for access to OpenAPI (Swagger) file is not supported
 - OAuth2 authentication type is not supported in real-time flows due to platform limitations
