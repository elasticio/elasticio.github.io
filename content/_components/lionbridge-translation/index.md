## Triggers

This component has no trigger functions. This means it will not be accessible to
select as a first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

To translate some text from one language to another, Lionbridge uses delayed jobs. That means that you will not be able to receive a translated text immediately in response to a request for translation. Therefore, you need to make a request to create a translation job, then get the code of your request and periodically poll Lionbridge to find out the status of your request. Once you get the status `REVIEW_TRANSLATION`, you can make a request to receive translation.

To create translation job you can use these 4 actions:
 - `Request translation job (Simple)`
 - `Request translation job (Batch)`
 - `Request translation job (Object properties)`
 - `Request translation job (Array of objects)`

`Batch` means that you can specify multiple source phrases and multiple target languages

`Simple` means that you can specify only one source phrase and one target language.

To poll about job status use `Retrieve job status` action.

To retrieve translated phrase(s) use `Retrieve translation` action.

Actions's `in/out` schemas can be found at `/lib/schemas`

#### For `Request translation job (Simple)` and `Request translation job (Batch)` actions:

output message (Simple):

{
   "translations": [
       {
           "key": "color",
           "values": [
               {

    "size": "drei Pfund"
}
```

#### For `Request translation job (Array of objects)` action:

        },
    	{
    		"mood": "großartige Stimmung"
    	}
    ]
}
```

## Usage example in flows:

To conveniently use this component, you should create two flows with such structures:

first flow:
```
<webhook> (retrieves input message for one of requestTranslationJob*** actions and sends it next)

⇓

<Lionbridge translate> (one of requestTranslationJob*** actions retrieves message from webhook and returns jobCode)

⇓

<Key:Value storage> (saves jobCode from previous step as "pending job")
```

second flow:
```
<Timer>

⇓

<Key:Value storage> (read and return an array of jobCodes of "pending job")

⇓

<Node.js Code> (inside forEach loop emits every jobCode separately to the next step)

⇓

<Lionbridge translate> (return status of job by dint of "Retrieve job status" action)

⇓

<Filter> (compares body.statusCode to be equal "REVIEW_TRANSLATION". subsequest step will fire if filter expression returned - true)

⇓

<Key:Value storage> (removes jobCode from storage)

⇓

<Lionbridge translate> (retrieve translation result using jobCode)

⇓

[translated data comes to this step as message and you can use it as you wish]
```
