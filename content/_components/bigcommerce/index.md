## General information

This is the component for working with BigCommerce online stores on [{{site.data.tenant.name}} platform](http://www.{{site.data.tenant.name}}).

### Purpose

The component allows you to connect to the BigCommerce platform through REST API. For more information about BigCommerce API, visit the [BigCommerceâ€™s official documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/about-our-api).

## Credentials

To use the BigCommerce connector, you need the following:

### Store hash

Specify your unique ID for store.

### Access Token

The following steps outline how to generate store API Credentials.
1. Navigate to **Advanced Settings > API Accounts > Create API Account.**
1. Give the account a name (it will only be visible to store users).
1. In the **OAuth Scopes** section, select the minimum scopes the app will require.
1. Select **Save**.

Lookup an object by ID.

#### Input field description

* **Object type to Lookup** - a dropdown list where you should choose the object type, which you want to lookup. E.g. `Product`
* **Allow ID to be omitted** - checkbox, if checked - ID can be omitted and the empty object will be returned, else - ID is required.

### Lookup Objects

Lookup objects satisfying specified criteria.

#### Input fields description

* **Object type to Lookup** - a dropdown list where you should choose the object type, which you want to lookup. E.g. `Product`;
* **Output method** - a dropdown list of following values: `Emit all`, `Emit page` and `Emit individually`;
* **Number of search terms** - a text field where you can specify a number of search terms (not less than 0 and not greater than 99). If 0 is specified then all records will be returned.

#### Metadata description

The input metadata can contain different fields depending on the configuration field **Output method** :

**Output method** - `Emit all` or `Emit individually`:
* **Maximum number of records** - an optional positive integer (the default value is 250);

**Output method** - `Emit page`:
* **Page size** - a required integer from the interval [1-250]. It defaults to 250 if a value not from the interval is specified;
* **Page number** - a required non-negative integer (greater than 0); It defaults to 1 if a negative value is specified.

Note that the number of records the component emits may affect the performance of the platform/component.

Groups of fields for each search term go next:

* **Field name** - a string represents a lookup field (a list of allowed values is available);
* **Field value** - a string represents value for selected field.

#### Output

The output data depends on the configuration field **Output method**:  
**Output method** - `Emit all`, `Emit page`: an object with key ```results``` that has an array of records as its value;  
**Output method** - `Emit individually`: a record.

### Lookup Set Of Objects By Unique Criteria

Action to bulk map product SKUs to BigCommerce product IDs

>**Please Note:** If no objects found - error will be thrown

#### Input fields description

* **Object type** - a dropdown list where you should choose the object type, which you want to lookup. E.g. `Products`;
* **Conversion direction** - a dropdown list where you should choose direction for conversion: `SKU -> BigCommerce ID` or `BigCommerce ID -> SKU`;

#### Metadata description

* **List of SKUs to map** (array, required) - list of SKUs values to map. E.g `["OLP", "TVBS", "KPZE"]`
If `Conversion direction` is set to `BigCommerce ID -> SKU`:
* **Big Commerce IDs to map** (array, required) - list of IDs values to map. E.g `[23, 34, 45, 56]`

#### Output field description

* **result** (object, required) - An object which contains BigCommerce IDs and SKUs as key value pairs

### Upsert Object

Updates selected object if it is present and can be found by it's ID. Otherwise creates new object with supplied parameters.
Action updates or creates a single object.

#### Config fields

* **Object Type** (string, required). Includes Customers & Orders.

Support for other object types will be added shortly.

#### Input metadata

All required and optional metadata fields, obtained dynamically based on the type of the current `Object`.

#### Output metadata

The object that was created or updated by result of the action.

## Limitations

* Actions except `Make Raw Request`, `Lookup Object (at most 1)`, `Lookup Set Of Objects By Unique Criteria`, `Upsert Object` and trigger `Get New and Updated Objects` are not fully tested, use them on your own risk only.* Between each two term's group of fields implicitly applied "AND" logic.
* The maximum number of `Products` returned is 250.
