During the credentials creation you can either select existing OAuth2 Client
from the drop-down list or [choose to create a new OAuth2 Client](creating-oauth-app-for-hubspot)
to use your created OAuth2 App in HubSpot.

## Known Limitations

1. [Rate Limits](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/usage-details#rate-limits)
2. Please, use some timer (around 5sec) if you are going to implement flow like `Upsert Object Action` -> any type of `Lookup Object(s) Action` with enabled feature `Enable download attachments`. Uploading the file to Hubspot on `Upsert Object Action` takes some time, so it is possible to receive `404` error on lookup.
