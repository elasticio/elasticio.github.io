## Credentials

Microsoft Dynamics Business Central APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. To establish a connection, you need to perform the following three steps:

**1.** Register an OAuth App in Azure Active Directory:

  * Start by registering an OAuth App in the Azure Active Directory.
  * Follow the steps outlined in [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to register your application.
  
  > **Note**: Specify the [Redirect URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-redirect-uri) according to documentation and ensure it is used [according to callback](/guides/oauth-callback-redirect-url.html).

  > **Note**: Make sure that the application is given the necessary [permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#more-on-api-permissions-and-admin-consent) to work with OAuth in Azure Active Directory.

**2.** Create an Auth Client on the Platform:

  * On the platform you are using, create an authentication client that includes the information of the OAuth App registered in step 1.
  * Ensure that the client configuration aligns with the details provided during the registration of the OAuth App.

**3.** Generate a Secret for the OAuth App:

  * Generate a secret on the platform to be used by the OAuth App registered in step 1.
  * This secret is a crucial part of the authentication process and must be securely stored.
  
>**Warning:** To maintain a smooth experience, we recommend reusing stored credentials where possible. Duplicating secrets across OAuth clients can result in errors and complications.

### Fields mapping

**1.** `Client ID` can be found at `Application (client) ID` (see picture below)

**2.** `Authorization Endpoint` is equal `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/authorize?resource=https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`, where `tenantId` can be found at `Directory (tenant) ID` (see picture below)

**3.** `Token Endpoint` is equal `https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}/oauth2/token?resource=https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`, where `tenantId` can be found at `Directory (tenant) ID` (see picture below)

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/client-id.png" title="Application (client) ID" %}

**4.** `Client Secret` follow link `Certificates & secrets` (see picture below) and use `Value` section

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/client-secret.png" title="Client Secret" %}

### Credentials creation

During credentials creation you would need to:

- select `OAuth2` drop-down list `Type`.
- select existing Auth Client from drop-down list `Choose Auth Client` or create the new one.

For creating Auth Client you should specify following fields:

| Field name | Description |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                   | your Auth Client's name |
| Client ID              | your `Application (client) ID` |
| Client Secret          | your `Value` from `Client secrets` |
| Authorization Endpoint | set: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/authorize?resource=https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`, where `tenantId` is user domain name |
| Token Endpoint         |  set: `https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}/oauth2/token?resource=https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`, where `tenantId` is user domain name             |

> **Note!**: All of the above fields are mandatory

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/auth-client.png" title="Auth client" %}

- fill field ``Name Your Credential``
- fill field ``Environment Name`` - required, field indicates what environment to be used. How to get a list of business central environments see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/api-get-environments). Example: `Production`.
Base URL for this component is `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/${environmentName}/api/v2.0`
- click on ``Authenticate`` button - the process would take you to Microsoft Dynamics to log-in and give permissions to the platform to access your service.
- click on ``Verify`` button for verifying your credentials.
- click on ``Save`` button for saving your credentials.

### How to get Microsoft Dynamics Business Central instance URL

To access the Microsoft Dynamics Business Central Instance URL, follow these steps:

1. Register on Microsoft Dynamics Business Central:
   Start by registering on the [Microsoft Dynamics Business Central platform](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/signin/?ru=https%3A%2F%2Fbusinesscentral.dynamics.com%2F%3FnoSignUpCheck%3D1).
2. Navigate to the Admin Center:
   Open the **"Settings"** tab, and select **"Admin Center"**.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/admin-center-settings.png" title="Admin Center - Settings" %}

3. Access Environments:
   In the **"Admin Center"** page, navigate to the **"Environments"** section. Choose the specific environment you are interested in by clicking on it.

{% include img.html max-width="100%" url="img/admin-center-environments.png" title="Admin Center - Environments" %}

4. Retrieve the Instance URL:
   Once you are on the environment details page, locate the URL containing the instance ID. This URL is crucial for accessing Authorization and Token endpoints.
