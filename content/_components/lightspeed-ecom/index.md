## Authentication

You should request API keys for your shop (`api_key` & `api_secret`) via ticket to support.

Authentication is managed via HTTP authentication. There are several clusters which your app can be installed on. During the installation you should get the `cluster_id`. Please make sure you specify API requests to the correct cluster URL.

**Cluster URLs**
There are two clusters which your app can be installed on. During the installation we send you the `cluster_id`. Please make sure you send API requests to the correct cluster.

**CLUSTERS**

## Additional info

### Pagination

The component is providing request of a whole list of an entity by iterative API requests without user intervention.

A bit of theory:

Lightspeed eCom API limits the number of returned objects to `50` by default and `250` as max. When requesting large data sets it may be necessary to send multiple requests to retrieve all of the data. The meta-dictionary that’s returned tells the current page, and if there’s another page of results after this one, the next entry gives you the URL where it can be fetched.
Depending on the structure of your data, it’s possible that the API may not be able to return the number of resources requested before a HTTP 504 (Gateway Timeout) happens. For example, if your first 100 orders have 1,000 line items each, you might hit a 429 when trying to fetch them.
You can control the page size for a GET request with the limit parameter.

Coming back to the component:

In the component, at the `Polling Trigger` configuration you can configure count of fetching results per page by an appropriate configuration field.
If you notice that 429s are coming back, you should reduce the limit until you start getting 200s. A sensible strategy for this is probably to iteratively halve the page size until you stop getting 429s.
