# Sugar CRM Component

[SugarCRM](https://www.sugarcrm.com) is a CRM system with a  a simple user
interface, industry-leading customer experience, and an intuitive customization
platform.

This is an open source component template for [Sugar
CRM](https://www.sugarcrm.com) which is developed specifically to run on
[elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform"). You can
clone it and change it as you wish.

# Authentication
In order for the elastic.io platform to authenticate with SugarCRM, the
following tasks need to be completed:
* An admin must manually create an OAuth App on the SugarCRM instance through SugarCRM's UI *(step by step instructions below)*
* [If using a version of SugarCRM that was released after Winter '18, you must
register a platform on your SugarCRM
instance](https://community.sugarcrm.com/community/developer/blog/2017/11/20/unknown-platforms-to-be-restricted-in-winter-18-release)
  * With Sugar 8, this can [be done through the
  UI](http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/8.0/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/index.html#Configure_API_Platforms)
  *(step by step instructions below)*
  * It is also possible to load new platform values by [creating and installing
   a
   module](https://community.sugarcrm.com/docs/DOC-5875-tutorial-how-to-register-custom-platforms-in-sugar-instances)
* Finally, authentication information for your Sugar instance must be entered into the elastic.io UI *(step by step instructions below)*

## Creating an app on a SugarCRM instance
In order the platform to connect to your SugarCRM instance, an app needs to be
created on that instance.  Below are the steps to do so.  Once that is done, you
will provide a valid username and password to the elastic.io platform.  The
platform will exchange that username and password for a token.  In a production
system, the best practice is to create a dedicated user for the elastic.io
platform.  This user should have the minimum required permissions.

1. As an admin on your SugarCRM instance, go to the Administration panel

## Authentication on elastic.io

![screenshot from 2018-05-04 13-45-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5710732/39626260-7a34e34c-4fa1-11e8-8cb2-de57183cd403.png)

Fill in the following for your account:
* **Name Your Account**: Name to identify this account on elastic.io
* **Your SugarCRM domain**: URL of your Sugar CRM instance
* **Your login**: Username used to login to SugarCRM instance
* **Your password**: Password used to login to SugarCRM instance
* **Your OAuth 2.0 Consumer Key**: Value created in step 5ii.
* **Your OAuth 2.0 Consumer Secret**: Value created in step 5iii.
* **Custom Platform Value**: Platform value registered above.

For real-time tasks please use separate oauth keys to avoid login conflicts.

Parameter `platform` should be set to some custom string but should be unique per sugar component in order to avoid any potential login conflicts.
So now `platform` is "`$TASK_ID:$STEP_ID`".

platform via webhooks.  In order to do so, select **Fetch new and updated
objects (getObjects - Webhook)**.  When a flow with this trigger is started, the
elastic.io platform will register webhooks on the SugarCRM instance.  When the
flow is stopped, this webhook will be destroyed by the platform.

## Fetch Deleted Objects from SugarCRM - Webhook

It is possible to have the ids of deleted objects be pushed to the elastic.io
platform via webhooks.  In order to do so, select **Fetch deleted objects
(getDeletedObjects - Webhook)**.  When a flow with this trigger is started, the
elastic.io platform will register webhooks on the SugarCRM instance.  When the
flow is stopped, this webhook will be destroyed by the platform.

# Actions
