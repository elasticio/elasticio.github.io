## Description

The Assetbank Component facilitates interaction with the [Assetbank API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10518051/TVK8Zyxr).

## Credentials

To build an integration flow, the first step is to create OAuth2 credentials by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Admin` > `System` > `API`.
2. Click the `Add new OAuth2 credentials` button.
3. Fill in the fields:
- **Name** (optional) - Assign any desired name for the credentials.
- **Description** (optional) - Assign any desired description for the credentials.
- **Client Id** - Automatically generated, but clicking the "Generate" link will create a new 32-character hex string.
- **Secret** - Not generated by default, but clicking "Generate" will create a 64-character hex string.
- **Redirect URLs** - Set as `https://{your-tenant-address}/callback/oauth2`, where `{your-tenant-address}` is the domain of the integration platform.
4. Save your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` - as they will be needed for component credentials.
5. Click the `Save` button.

Note: To enable this feature, you must have an admin role.

For more details, refer to [Asset Bank API - OAuth2](https://support.assetbank.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015325197-Asset-Bank-API-OAuth2).

    * **Client Secret** (string, required) - Enter the `Client Secret`  from the previous steps.

    * **Token Endpoint** (string, required) - Refresh token endpoint `https://{your-assetbank-domain}/oauth/token`, where `{your-assetbank-domain}` is the server name of your Assetbank installation.
* **Name Your Credential** (string, required) - Put any name you prefer.
* **Server Name** (string, required) - The domain of your Assetbank installation, example: `example.assetbank-server.com/assetbank-example`.
* **Number of retries** (number, optional, 5 by default) - How many times component should retry to make request.
* **Delay between retries** (number ms, optional, 10000 by default) - How much time wait until a new try.
