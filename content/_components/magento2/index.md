## Known limitations

1. Current component version was tested with Magento2 v2.3.4. Correct component behavior is not guaranteed for other Magento2 versions.

2. Deprecated triggers and actions don't support `Integration Token authorization`, only `Admin Token authorization`.

3. Currently Magento2 has a bug where encoded URI's are not recognised and will throw errors. For example if you have `some/sku`, it
will be encoded to `some%2Fsku`. However, due to the bug this will throw errors. Refrain from using URI's that have special characters which
are meant to be encoded.
