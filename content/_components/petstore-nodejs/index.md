## Description

Petstore Node.js component template for the platform.

This is a component template which we commonly refer as **the first step of the development**
for creating a component to deploy into our platform. This component comes with
a basic architecture which can be used on our platform. You can clone it and use it.

## File Structure

The structure of **petstore-component-nodejs** component is quite flexible. The
integration platform expects only two files to be present in the main directory.
These are the `component.json` and `package.json`. Our documentation on
[how to build a component in node.js](/guides/building-nodejs-component.html)
has more about each file and their function.
