## Description

Klaviyo is a customer data and marketing automation platform tailored for e-commerce businesses. It empowers users to collect, analyze, and utilize customer data to create highly targeted email and SMS marketing campaigns, automate workflows, and foster personalized customer engagement. Klaviyo integrates seamlessly with platforms like Shopify and Magento, making it an indispensable tool for improving customer retention and driving sales.

The Klaviyo Component provides a simple way to interact with the [Klaviyo API](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/api_overview), enabling efficient integration with Klaviyo's powerful features.

## Credentials

This component supports API key authentication. To obtain an API key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Klaviyo account](https://www.klaviyo.com/settings/account/api-keys)
2. Navigate to **Settings -> API Keys**
3. Create a **Private API Key**
4. Define the required scopes for the API key
5. Use the generated key in this component to authenticate your requests

Now you can set the component credentials:

- **API key**: *(required, string)* - API key you created in the account
- **Revision**: *(optional, string)* - API version to use. Default: `2024-10-15`. Refer to the [Versioning docs](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/api_versioning_and_deprecation_policy) to find the versions available.

**Important!** Note that in order to successfully verify the credentials in the component, the api key you create must have *at least* the scope: `List: Read Access`.
