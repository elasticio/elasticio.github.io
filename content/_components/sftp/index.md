## Known limitations

* The maximum file size accepted by the SFTP component is limited to 100 MB.
* The attachments mechanism does not work with [Local Agent Installation](/getting-started/local-agent)
* `Get new and updated files` trigger mechanism is based on SFTP file `modifyTime` metadata field. For correct processing the trigger requires correct time configuration on the SFTP server.
* `Get new and updated files` trigger does not support empty files processing.
* `Get new and updated files` trigger does not support `fetch page` Emit Behaviour
