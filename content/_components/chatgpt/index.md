## Description

ChatGPT Component is designed to connect with ChatGPT using [REST OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) The current release of component tested with the `Nov 6th, 2023` [API version](https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog).

## Credentials

First, [Create OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [Sign in](https://platform.openai.com/login). Next, navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and *Create new secret key*, optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.

* **API Key** (string, required) - API Token generated as described above.

## Triggers

This component does not have trigger functions, making it inaccessible as the first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions

### Send Request

Simply send a request. Only text-based models are supported so far (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5). Stream mode is not supported currently.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Organization** (string, optional) - For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization. Leave it blank if you only belong to one organization.
* **Select model** (dropdown, required) - List and describe the various models available in the API. Only text-based models are supported so far (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5). You should select a model which is supported in your billing plan. Otherwise, an error will be returned.

The metadata is rather general for different use-cases. To build a correct request please consult the [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

Here is an example of a very basic valid request:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hi there, what is your name?"
    }
  ]
}
```
