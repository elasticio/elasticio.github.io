## Description

The ChatGPT Component enables interaction with ChatGPT via the [OpenAI REST API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
The current release of this component has been tested with the `March 20th, 2025` [API version](https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog).

## Credentials

To use this component, follow these steps:

1. Create an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [sign in](https://platform.openai.com/login).
2. Navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and “Create new secret key”, optionally naming the key.
3. Save your API key securely and do not share it.

> **API Key** (string, required) - The OpenAI API token generated as described above.

## Triggers

This component does not have trigger functions, making it inaccessible as the first component during the integration flow design.

## Actions
  
### Send Request

Simply sends a request, supporting text-based models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) as well as attachments (images and files).
Stream mode is not supported currently.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Organization** (string, optional) - For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization. Leave it blank if you only belong to one organization.
* **Select model** (dropdown, required) - A dynamic list of the models available in your account. Only text-based GPT models are supported so far.
* **API call request timeout, in seconds** (dropdown, optional) - Depending on the input text complexity it might take long time for the API to generate a response and reply. It can easily take up to 40-60 seconds. If you are getting timeout errors, increase this value. Defaults to 60 seconds.

#### Input Metadata

Please refer to the Input Schema file for the full list of metadata fields. The metadata is rather general for different use-cases. To build a correct request please consult the [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

## Known Limitations

  1. Only PDF files (`.pdf`) are supported for file attachments.
  2. Images must meet OpenAI's input requirements. See [Image Input Requirements](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?api-mode=chat#image-input-requirements).
  3. Not all models support attachments (images, files). Before sending a request, please verify model compatibility in the [OpenAI Models documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).
