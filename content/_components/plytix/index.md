=======
### Link or Unbind object

Action execute `Link` or `Unbind` operation for objects:

 - `Products` <-> `Assets`

 - `Products` <-> `Variations`
 - `Products` <-> `Relationships`
 - `Product Attribute Groups` <-> `Attribute`
 - `Assets` <-> `Categories`

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (dropdown, required): Object-type to lookup on. E.g `Assets`.
* **Operation** - (dropdown, required): `Link` or `Unbind` operation.

#### Input Metadata

Generated dynamically and depends on the object type, typically: parent object ID and label object ID or object to be linked or unbounded to the parent object.

#### Output Metadata

Dynamically generated, depended on Object Type.

### Lookup Object (at most one)

Lookup a single object by a selected field that uniquely identifies it.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (string, required): Object-type to lookup on. E.g `Assets`.
* **Lookup Criteria** - (dropdown, required): A list of object parameters that can uniquely identify the object in the database.
* **Object Attributes** - (multi-dropdown, required): fields that will be included in the response. If left empty - only some system-required fields will be returned.
* **Allow criteria to be omitted** - (boolean, optional): If selected field `Lookup Criteria Value` becomes optional.
* **Allow zero results** - (boolean, optional): When selected, if the object is not found - an empty object will be returned instead of throwing error.

#### Input Metadata

* **Lookup Criteria Value** - (string, required unless `Allow criteria to be omitted` is selected): Value for unique search criteria in `Lookup Criteria` configuration field.

#### Output Metadata

Object with result of lookup as value.

### Lookup Objects (plural)

Lookup a set of object by defined criteria list. Can be emitted in different way.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (dropdown, required): Object-type to lookup on. E.g `Assets`.
