### New Features

* Introduced an experimental feature, such as `keen flows`. All steps of the Keen's flow launch simultaneously as the flow starts and continue running until the flow's status changes to `sleeping`.
* Introduced the UI's option for defining the `CRON`'s expression to schedule flow's executions. This functionality is available in the Designer's flow under the `Settings` tab.
* Made the Node.js SDK for proper RabbitMQ's disconnection. In case, one of the RabbitMQ's instances fails or reports errors, the Node.js process terminates immediately and then restarts by the Platform's orchestrator. Thus the process can reconnect to the already running RabbitMQ's instance. 
The `workspace_id` and `workspace_role` are optional attributes
that refer to the `/v2/contracts/:id/invites` endpoint. In case the `workspace_role` attribute
has already been provided, then the `workspace_role` will be required.

### Fixed Bugs

* Now it is possible to delete a credential even if an integration flow is using it.
